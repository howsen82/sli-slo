By bringing together representatives from product management, engineering, design, and customer support, organizations can maintain diverse perspectives and insights throughout the SLO management life cycle. This collaboration fosters a shared understanding of customer needs and ensures that SLIs and SLOs are consistently relevant and meaningful across the functional areas they were designed for.

This is not to be confused with sending and receiving status updates. Truly engage in meaningful connections for validating how things are being done, where they are being measured, and ongoing relevant processes to continuously validate the team is on the right track.

## Incorporating customer satisfaction metrics

Incorporating customer satisfaction metrics such as **Net Promoter Score** (**NPS**), **Customer Satisfaction** (**CSAT**), and **Customer Effort Score** (**CES**) into SLI and SLO monitoring provides valuable qualitative and quantitative insights into the user experience. This helps organizations measure how well their services align with the customer experience. NPS and CSAT ratings offer quantitative measures of customer sentiment, while feedback forms such as surveys and user interviews provide qualitative insights into user perceptions and preferences. By incorporating these metrics into SLI and SLO monitoring, organizations can track customer satisfaction levels and proactively address any issues or concerns that arise.

Maintaining a customer-centric focus throughout the process of customer journey mapping in reliability engineering is essential for delivering products and services that meet the needs and expectations of users. By integrating customer-focused practices into SLI and SLO development, involving cross-functional teams and stakeholders, conducting regular reviews and updates based on customer feedback, and incorporating customer satisfaction metrics into monitoring and reporting, organizations can drive continuous improvement and ensure customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Incorporating usability testing

By gathering feedback directly from users and conducting usability tests, teams can easily do the following:

* Identify usability issues
* Uncover areas for improvement
* Validate design decisions

Integrating findings from test outcomes into iterative development processes enables teams to iteratively refine and enhance products and services based on real user insights. This ultimately leads to achieving a higher level of customer satisfaction and engagement through an evidence-based process.

# Summary

By adopting a customer-centric approach through SLI and SLO implementation, organizations will better understand and address customer needs by ensuring business solutions meet their expectations. In the long term, this will improve the reliability and performance of their systems and services and drive business success.

By integrating the user journey into engineering practices, the organization enforces internal alignment of SLIs and SLOs with customer expectations. This helps the organization to create more meaningful and impactful experiences for their customers that can be aligned with data-driven business decisions, thus improving business outcomes.

With continuous measurement, analysis, and iteration, organizations can build a customer-centric culture and deliver value that resonates with their customers due to improved observability of the systems and processes being used to drive decisions. In the following chapter, we will discuss the fundamentals of observable systems, which provide the organization with the level of visibility needed to build SLIs. Through observing the right components and processes, we can set a solid foundation for measuring the right metrics in the most accurate and sensible way, improving the thresholds we follow to measure system performance.
