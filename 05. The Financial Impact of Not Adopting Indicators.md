# The Financial Impact of Not Adopting Indicators

In the previous chapters, we were able to highlight the hierarchy of reliability and observability concepts as they relate to SLIs and the importance of building a dedicated team to manage each component of the process. This chapter highlights the economic benefits of doing so and the financial impact associated with the adoption or lack thereof regarding SLIs. We will begin by taking some time to explore the core concepts of reliability engineering as they relate to the economic benefits. With the rapid development of modern businesses via technology, reliability isn’t just a luxury; it’s a necessity. You can expect to learn more about the tangible costs associated with unreliable systems and explore how prioritizing reliability can lead to significant cost efficiencies.

Without a strong focus on reliability measured through SLIs, systems are more prone to numerous negative impacts, including the extreme case of system downtime. SLIs provide actionable insights to ensure the system meets reliability targets and avoid economic losses associated with outages. This downtime can result in significant economic losses due to missed opportunities, decreased productivity, and potential damage to the business’s reputation.

Let’s consider the case of a major e-commerce platform. Any downtime, even for a few minutes, can translate into substantial economic losses. If, during peak shopping seasons such as Black Friday, the business experiences downtime, every second can result in millions of dollars in missed opportunities. By investing in robust reliability measures, such as implementing **site reliability engineering** (**SRE**), with well-defined SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets, this platform can remain proactive and minimize downtime. SLOs set clear reliability targets, while error budgets allow for controlled experimentation without risking SLA violations, safeguarding revenue and customer trust.

In this chapter, we will cover the following main topics:

* The unintended consequences of not investing in reliability
* Communicating economic implications within your organizations

Let’s get started!

# The unintended consequences of not investing in reliability

Although we primarily discuss investing in reliability engineering from a systems and platform perspective, it’s important to understand the intrinsic value increases that occur due to the intangible benefits that are not as immediate. This includes the various concepts previously mentioned in prior chapters, such as customer centricity, impact on the organization’s brand, and the customer relationship, all of which impact the business’s bottom line. We need a way to conceptually tie intangible aspects into service-level measurements to tie and align the value into strategic direction and decision-making.

Although this book does not extensively discuss the topic, error budgets contribute to the decision-making aspects by providing the team and broader organization with increased visibility of technical outage limits allowed before impacting the customer experience. They are equally as important to any reliability engineering organization. Although we mention them in a later section and discuss the concept later in the book in *Chapter 15*, when discussing financial investments and the economics of reliability engineering, it is important to at least introduce them so that we understand the correlation and take concepts such as the error burn rate into consideration.

In simplest terms, your error budget is the maximum allowable amount of time or room for errors or failures for a system or process to occur in a specific period. You can refer to Google’s SRE Workbook for an example of an error budget policy (<https://sre.google/workbook/error-budget-policy/>).

According to the latest report prepared for Salesforce by IT & Data Management Research of EMA (<https://www.servicenow.com/lpebk/enterprise-sre.html>), “*Reliability, because features that aren’t available don’t count.*” If we are not implementing processes that ensure maximum availability, then we are not performing at our best. When approaching the SRE function from an economic benefit perspective, it’s beneficial to consider questions such as the following:

* What is the minimum level of service that a user will find acceptable for any given task, at a not-to-exceed cost that makes sense from a business point of view?
* How can a specific level of service reliability be quantified, monitored, and enforced?
* What are the earliest and best indicators of any possible service degradation?
* How can automation eradicate repetitive, manual tasks that waste time and add no value?

At first glance, the previous questions appear as if they may be negligible, but underneath the surface, there is a ripple effect that begins to emerge. The goal of SRE is typically thought of as finding an issue, fixing the issue, and automating where it makes sense, as depicted in *Figure 5.1*. However, an additional component is being able to quantify the metric in a way that you can financially tie it back to organizational value and the bottom line by improving upon SLA commitments.

**Figure 5.1 – The cyclic task/responsibilities of SRE engineers at a high level**

Let’s explore the impact of the ripple effect, depicted in *Figure 5.1*, that can occur when SRE is not prioritized or implemented as needed.

A business’s success is often referred to and measured by its profits and losses, overlooking the importance of how not incorporating a framework for accountability can prove to be a costly oversight. Regarding this book, SRE is the recommended framework or tool for doing just that. SRE is fundamentally a set of core principles to measure how your systems are performing according to your customer’s expectations.

When implemented correctly, the selected metrics, often regarded as the pulse of service performance, provide many invaluable insights into the health and performance of the respective operations. Yet, despite their significance, many organizations continue to operate in the dark, oblivious to the potential financial repercussions of neglecting SLIs.

Now, let’s imagine an e-commerce giant, by the name of **Technology Insights**, who plans to disregard SLIs altogether in pursuit of rapid expansion. This negligence can lead to SLA breaches, damaging customer satisfaction and trust. Monitoring SLIs ensures that the business meets SLA commitments, thereby preserving customer relationships and reducing financial risks. With their focus solely on acquiring new customers and scaling operations, **Technology Insights**, or **Tech Insights** as we will refer to it, fails to monitor critical indicators such as website uptime, response time, and customer satisfaction levels regarding their application and platform performance, missing out on the opportunity to improve through the customer experience and feedback. Some of the disadvantages of ignoring this opportunity are as follows:

* Increased engineer burnout. This can also creep into burnout of other staff outside of your engineering and support domains.
* Burnout of your employees can also result in high turnover rates within your organization.
* Decreased ability to mitigate risks such as security vulnerabilities and compliance failures, resulting in increased downtime and a more negative customer experience.
* The previously mentioned reasons can incur additional financial losses by increased opportunities for data breaches and financial fraud.

Although it’s important to highlight the disadvantages, we also want to mention the advantages, especially when considering platforms and applications within the financial industry, warehouse management, human resource information systems, and many other platforms and applications that support various levels of government services within the public sector. Some of the advantages that directly improve your organization’s bottom line are as follows:

* Being able to proactively monitor and manage your incident lifecycle management processes and systems.
* Improving the software and development process through increased and efficient automation practices.
* Efficient scalability and capacity planning capabilities through identifying bottlenecks and improved performance testing.
* As mentioned earlier, improving security vulnerabilities.
* Providing an opportunity for your organization and team to learn together through iteration and implementing processes such as retrospectives.

There are likely many other benefits that we can list here, but let’s take a minute to continue exploring the disadvantages of not investing in reliability. To further explore disadvantages, we can align each one with a concept implemented in the practice of reliability engineering. Each concept is there to help reduce the negative impacts. Before we go further into the discussion, let’s learn about the concept of error budgets and how they fit into the bigger picture.

## Error budgets as a defense mechanism

This chapter is written under the assumption that you, the reader, maintain some level of familiarity with the concept of error budgets as they relate to your indicators and objectives. Your error budget represents the maximum allowable amount of time or errors a system can tolerate without breaching the defined SLO. It is derived directly from SLIs that measure critical metrics such as latency, availability, and error rates. Without accurate SLIs, the calculation of error budgets and their alignment with SLOs is incomplete. Let’s refer to *Figure 5.2* as a refresher of what this means in numerical form.

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_05_2.jpg)<br>
**Figure 5.2 – Error budget in comparison to SLO based on a 28-day period**

*Figure 5.2* provides the relationship between the SLO you would like to achieve and the allowable length of time of outage per year or month. Earlier in this chapter, we mentioned Tech Insights, an e-commerce organization, disregarding the need to measure the response times for certain customer workflows in the system. However, they have implemented external facing SLAs providing the customer with performance-level commitments. Let’s pretend this commitment is three 9s or 99.9% of availability for some workflow focused on the customer experience or some application. The expectation internally is that SLOs are defined as measurable targets that encompass the components necessary to maintain service reliability. Internal SLOs should be set slightly more stringent than the external SLA to provide a buffer and ensure SLA commitments are not breached.

Internally, we’d want to implement an objective that was a bit more aggressive to ensure we do not breach the agreement. Therefore, we might decide to implement an internal SLO of 99.95%. This affords the team 4.38 hours per year or 21.56 minutes per month of downtime for the respective services. In some organizations, this can seem a bit aggressive. As a rule, achieving higher levels of reliability (9s) requires exponential increases in operational effort, monitoring, and infrastructure investments. This is due to the diminishing returns of reliability improvement as systems approach perfection. For instance, moving from 99.9% to 99.99% availability necessitates significantly more stringent monitoring, fault-tolerance mechanisms, and operational readiness. Monitoring, on-call scheduling, and the scope of disaster recovery and other processes need to be taken into consideration. This is beyond the scope of this discussion, but it is important to mention.

To achieve a specific level of 9s, Tech Insights would want to perform some assessment to determine what processes are currently in place and what processes they need to implement to achieve the level of desired performance. As the number of 9s your organization wants to achieve increases, the amount of time available for any issues and outages (error budget) will decrease. This will also result in an increase in costs and the effort to remain in compliance with the error budget. In *Figure 5.3*, we can picture this relationship and correlation in the following manner:

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_05_3.jpg)<br>
**Figure 5.3 – A positive correlation between cost adjustment and required effort to achieve some level of 9s of reliability**

Now, let’s consider an instance where you’ve deployed a multi-region application into a cloud-hosted and multi-node container-orchestrated cluster (we will discuss it in detail in later chapters).

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_05_4.jpg)<br>
**Figure 5.4 – Multi-region cluster architecture**

Your commitment to the customer should explicitly define SLIs that measure the real-time performance of your service, such as latency, errors, and saturation. These indicators should inform SLOs, which are measurable performance targets aligned with customer expectations.

As a refresher, the four golden signals are metric categorizations that should be used during the monitoring process at a bare minimum, to ensure standard details are captured. The standard signals are latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. What does each of these mean to you?

* **Latency**: Captures the time it takes to serve a request between the identified endpoints.
* **Traffic**: Captures the total number of requests across the network.
* **Errors**: Captures the number of requests that fail.
* **Saturation**: Captures the load on your network and servers.

Capturing the four golden signals (latency, traffic, errors, and saturation) as SLIs provides visibility into your service’s health and directly supports meeting SLOs. This helps align operational efforts to fulfill SLAs and improve reliability, enabling on-call engineers to make informed decisions during live incidents.

As a result, at a bare minimum, your organization could consider each when developing your indicators to begin to experience the benefits of reliability as regards service levels. This does not include the many other practices of reliability that are not mentioned in this chapter.

Now, you might be asking yourself, “*How does this relate back to the disadvantages of not adopting reliability?*”. Let’s discuss the disadvantages that you can experience due to the earlier-mentioned ripple effect. An organization can experience the following negative effects:

* **Customer dissatisfaction and churn**: Unreliable systems can lead to customer dissatisfaction and churn. Losing customers due to poor reliability can have a direct impact on revenue and profitability, resulting in customers seeking out improved products from a competitor.

  Tech Insights’ SLIs, such as response time and error rate, indicate poor performance during holidays and peak shopping hours, breaching established SLOs. This degradation leads to abandoned shopping carts, missed sales opportunities, and increased customer churn. By leveraging SRE practices to monitor SLIs and adjust thresholds dynamically during peak times, the organization can prevent downtime and ensure consistent customer experience.
* **Damage to brand reputation**: With many organizations continuing to shift business processes toward digital transformation, a tarnished reputation can spread faster than in previous times, due to the numerous digital platforms available to provide followers of that brand with information regarding the product and customer experience. This includes negative feedback as, according to a study conducted by Zendesk, customers are more likely to leave reviews for negative experiences than positive experiences (*2013, Customer Service and Business* *Results, Zendesk*).

  Tech Insights was once revered for its innovation and reliability. Due to a reduction in performance and availability, it now finds itself at the mercy of scathing reviews and negative publicity. Prospective customers eventually become wary of engaging with a brand plagued by service issues, which tends to result in turning to competitors offering a more seamless experience that meets their targeted needs.

  A study conducted by Colorado State University reported that negative reviews can have more of an impact on some of a business’s most important customers.
* **Escalating support costs**: Unreliable systems often require more frequent maintenance and support interventions. If we refer to *Figure 5.1* earlier in this chapter, SRE tasks are thought of as a cyclic set of tasks surrounding technical support. Instead, it should be thought of as incorporating theoretical principles into practice to guardrail issues from reoccurring and report also on performance. This mindset can lead to increased labor costs and the need for additional resources to resolve or mitigate an issue, which impacts organizational culture and the customer experience.

  As incoming customer complaints flood in, Tech Insights’ support teams become overwhelmed by support tickets and customer inquiries, resulting in stretched resources. With every minute spent addressing service-related issues, the cost of support escalates, further denting the company’s bottom line. Meanwhile, skilled engineers are diverted from strategic projects into firefighting mode, stunting innovation and hindering growth.

  With the stunt of innovation and growth hindered, organizations are also likely to experience increased engineer burnout and high rates of attrition.
* **Scalability challenges**: Systems that are not designed for reliability may struggle to scale effectively. This can result in additional costs associated with over-provisioning resources or retrofitting systems to handle increased loads.

  Consider Tech Insights during peak hours or holidays struggling to handle surges in user traffic due to system architecture. Without reliability practices in place to capture the time periods and components associated with bottlenecks, the engineering team could scale up application resources or add additional nodes to the cluster, which can result in over-provisioning and additional operational expenses.
* **Security vulnerabilities and regulatory compliance costs**: Unreliable systems are often more susceptible to security vulnerabilities and breaches. The economic costs of security incidents can include fines, legal fees, and remediation costs, while also resulting in damage to brand reputation. This is especially important when considering the handling of customer personal data with increased regulations, such as GDPR, in specific countries.

  A financial institution that experiences a data breach faces not only financial losses but also regulatory fines and reputational damage. Weaknesses in system reliability often result in security breaches, underscoring the importance of integrating security into every layer of infrastructure design. By implementing robust security measures alongside reliability practices, organizations can mitigate the economic impact of security incidents.

  In regulated industries such as healthcare, non-compliance with reliability standards can result in hefty penalties and legal expenses. A healthcare provider experiencing frequent system outages risks violating patient data privacy laws, inviting regulatory scrutiny and financial repercussions. By integrating reliability best practices and compliance standards, organizations can mitigate the risk of regulatory fines and safeguard their financial interests.
* **Long-term technical debt**: Neglecting reliability to benefit from short-term gains can result in the accumulation of technical debt over time. Addressing technical debt can become extremely costly, requiring significant investments in refactoring code and system architecture improvements, among other tasks.

  Tech Insights neglects to refactor legacy systems over time due to a lack of time and internal staff begins to face mounting maintenance costs and diminished agility. By proactively managing technical debt through SLOs, organizations can reduce long-term costs and future-proof their systems.
* **Lost revenue opportunities**: With the advancement of technology and the increase in digitization, every second counts. Tech Insights’ failure to meet SLA conditions, driven by unmet SLOs for availability and latency, results in immediate revenue losses due to transaction abandonment and long-term reputational damage. Establishing precise SLIs to measure transaction success rates and latency during high traffic periods can enable proactive remediation before breaching SLA agreements, safeguarding revenue and future opportunities. Potential partnerships and collaborations evaporate as industry peers view the company as unreliable and unstable. Unreliable systems may limit the ability of an organization to pursue new business opportunities or expand into new markets. This can result in missed revenue opportunities and potential competitive disadvantages. Coupling SLIs and SLOs to support SLAs helps organizations mitigate loss of revenue and opportunities.

  Imagine that Tech Insights is unable to launch a new product in a timely manner due to system instability with critical system components. Competitors can seize the opportunity, capturing market share and leaving the company at a competitive disadvantage. By investing in reliability engineering, organizations can seize business opportunities swiftly and stay ahead of the curve in dynamic markets.
* **Quantifying the costs**: While the financial impact of neglecting SLOs may vary depending on the scale and nature of the business, the cumulative effect is undeniable. Lost sales, increased support costs, damage to brand reputation, and missed growth opportunities all contribute to a significant dent in profitability. What initially seemed like minor deviations from service standards transitioned into a full-blown financial crisis. Lack of reliability can lead to inefficiencies in operations, such as manual intervention to address issues, firefighting, and ad hoc workarounds or short-term patching. These inefficiencies can increase operational costs and reduce overall productivity.

Tech Insights was previously plagued by unreliable inventory management systems and resorted to manual interventions and workarounds to fulfill orders on time. These inefficiencies incurred additional labor costs and eroded customer trust due to delayed shipments. Streamlining operations through reliable systems and automation backed by SLIs and SLOs, operations and fulfillment center teams can reduce costs and enhance customer satisfaction.

Each of these sections underscores the critical role of reliability in driving cost efficiencies and sustaining business success. By prioritizing reliability as a strategic imperative, organizations can minimize economic risks, unlock new opportunities, and cultivate a culture of resilience in an ever-changing digital landscape.

# Communicating economic implications within your organizations

For Tech Insights, the road to redemption begins with a fundamental shift in mindset. Recognizing the pivotal role of reliability engineering in defining SLIs, which form the basis of measurable SLOs, and ensuring that these SLOs align with externally committed SLAs is the start. The company agrees and commits to a holistic approach to service excellence. By investing in robust monitoring tools, implementing proactive maintenance strategies, and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, Tech Insights begins to embark on a journey toward reclaiming its position as a market leader.

Apart from getting started within an organization experiencing various levels of turmoil throughout, it is imperative that the key stakeholders can communicate the importance, benefits, and next steps to internal staff to create buy-in. Based on the previous sections, we might conclude that Tech Insights should consider the following actions, in the respective order:

1. Formulate the “why” behind service-level metric implementation:

   * For Tech Insights, these might be the various reasons mentioned previously packaged in a formal proposal document.

2. Communicate the “why” to internal stakeholders. This can also include a **proof of concept** (**POC**) of an end-to-end POC against an internal service or platform. Internal stakeholders might include the following:
   * The engineering teams and their respective management chain of a specific internal product or platform solution.
   * An internal SRE business group.
   * Internal customer support team managing customer support tickets.
   * External customer accounts identified through internal professional services groups.

3. Implement or begin your data-gathering process by first defining relevant SLIs for each system or service. SLIs should reflect critical user journeys and measure key aspects of reliability such as latency, availability, and error rates. This data will then inform the establishment of SLOs:

   * This step is dependent on the respective stakeholders:

     + Customer support might include internal support tickets and other methods of communication with customer accounts established by the support team’s process.
     + SRE business group or engineering teams’ data would include technical artifacts such as logs, design documents, and various other artifacts established around the product or product line.

   * For each group, the team should investigate whether the organization or group has externally published SLAs. If so, these commitments can guide the reliability targets. However, the team should first establish achievable SLOs using SLIs to determine realistic goals that align with both customer expectations and system capabilities.

4. Start your process on the targeted stakeholders using the outline provided in [*Chapter 6*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/6):
   * This could be the initial POC step if not implemented in *step 2*.

You’ll also need to emphasize how this information is communicated to the right staff members in a consumable way to drive internal agreement. The manner and method by which the team communicates with the engineering organization for buy-in differs from the method used with upper management responsible for sign-off, allocating resources, and budgeting.

As much as we discuss reliable applications and systems, it is equally important to ensure the methods and practices we use to communicate are equally reliable. Expect to see many of the topics mentioned in this chapter utilized in the workshop chapters that follow.

# Summary

Reliability is often a key differentiator for businesses but is reviewed in hindsight rather than thought of at the forefront. Failure to embrace SRE and deliver reliable services can result in a loss of competitive advantage and market share.

Equipped with a newfound appreciation for the importance of service-level measurements, Tech Insights, as well as your organization, can emerge from the shadows of uncertainty stronger and more resilient than ever before. By prioritizing service excellence and embracing a data-driven approach for service-level performance, the company not only safeguards its financial health but also lays the foundation for sustained growth and prosperity in an ever-evolving marketplace.

In today’s competitive and demanding technology industry, where success hangs in the balance, the significance of SLIs in conjunction with SLOs and SLAs cannot be overstated. Neglecting these interdependent metrics not only jeopardizes financial stability but also undermines the trust and confidence of customers and stakeholders alike. Organizations must prioritize defining SLIs that align with SLOs and support SLA commitments to ensure reliability and sustained trust. By taking advantage of the warning signs and proactively addressing service issues, organizations can unlock untapped potential and chart a course toward a brighter, more prosperous future.

In the next chapter, we will direct attention toward the steps following receiving buy-in within your organization. In more simplified terms, “I am ready to implement SLIs and SLOs in my organization and need to establish a process or method for kicking off the implementation conversation.” You can expect to navigate through the process using relatable examples across various aspects of an internal system.
