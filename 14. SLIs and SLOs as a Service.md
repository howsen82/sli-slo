# SLIs and SLOs as a Service

In chapters in the first part of this book, we discussed the history of reliability engineering, the core concepts of observability, and the importance of reliability engineering to service and application performance. In the chapters that followed, we discussed how to structure your service level indicator and objectives workshop and foster necessary discussions between the team, engineers, and invested stakeholders. This chapter can be considered a free-for-all, centering the discussion around delivering it to your target audience as a practice.

At this stage of the book, you might have already asked yourself, “What am I to do with all of this information now”? Or, even better, “How do I package this information as an internal or external service to improve customer experience”? In some cases, it may not suit you to market the information as a paid service but implement the process internally to ensure your internal engineering teams maintain an “as-a-Service” mentality. This can enable the team to effectively write code and build processes that align with the organization’s broader strategy and customer needs.

In [*Chapter 14*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/14) specifically, you can expect to cover the following topics:

* Developing an as-a-Service mindset
* What is X-as-a-Service?
* SLIs-as-a-Service
* SLIs-as-a-S Product lifecycle

# Developing an as-a-Service mindset

The goal of this chapter is not to build another “as-a-Service” title or category but to shift the mind toward thinking about internally conducting your workshops and implementing your service level measurements with the same delicacy that you would if conducting the former with external customers. With this thinking, you can expect to internally build the following:

* Improved mechanisms that better support your external customers.
* Improved comraderies and internal processes between engineering and other teams.
* Practices that help the organization align SLOs and SLIs with external SLAs, ensuring contractual commitments are met.
* Assurance that your internal engineering teams can map their daily operations to reliability-focused objectives, using SLIs and SLOs to inform broader organizational **Objectives and Key Results** (**OKRs**) or **Key Performance Indicators** (**KPIs**) related to system reliability and customer experience.

Your team might have all or some of the goals mentioned in mind. Before we get started, I encourage you to start this chapter with your end goal top of mind. Ask yourself some of the following questions:

* What stage of the process is my team, business unit, or organization in?
* What result am I trying to achieve?
* What is the culture of the target audience I am attempting to solve this problem for?
* Is this something I want to take on and build upon?
* How much time do I have to invest to build for the goal I want to achieve?

Once you can answer the questions mentioned, I encourage you to read the text and pull from it the parts that help you to achieve the goals identified from the responses. At the end of the day, each book represents the opinions of the author and a representation of the author’s experience.

In this instance, I’d like to highlight the many years I have spent working in software and platforms as a service, working in product support, and with product-focused engineering teams. So much so that I ended up enrolling in a product leadership program to challenge my own experience and knowledge outside of the technical scope. This information is mentioned to provide more context as to how we ended up here. Speaking of products, let’s kickstart the conversation here.

# What is X-as-a-Service?

If you made it as far as picking up this book and beginning to read it, I am working under the assumption that you are already familiar with the concept of “aaS” or as the section title suggests, “XaaS.” For the purposes of the text, “X” is simply a placeholder here. “**XaaS**” is an acronym that means “**Anything-as-a-Service**”. It can technically apply in this instance as well but was not the immediate goal. AaS refers to productizing or marketing something as a service, under some pricing model. You’re likely more familiar with the concepts of SaaS and PaaS, meaning software and platform as a service. In this instance, we are referring to service-level measurements as a service. However, that does not mean we cannot take the necessary features and create a platform as a service. It’s just not what we are referring to in this chapter.

Now that we have gotten that out of the way, why would you want to consider SLIs and SLOs as a service? To be frank, I am not sure. That is a question that only you can answer. However, when initially introduced to the concept of reliability engineering, it honestly felt like the discussion centered around infrastructure and being on call. I believe if the organization is experiencing an extreme level of incidents and constantly updating system code that is specific to customer incidents, as opposed to optimizing and refactoring iteratively, there must come a point where it revisits the fundamental practices and processes being used for service delivery.

My introduction to reliability engineering came at this peak sentiment, and after a period of my career where I witnessed an SRE team get dismantled for no reason of their own, other than being the business group that did not generate revenue. From a business perspective, this resulted in having less of an impact on the broader organization’s bottom line, despite it being a critical component of running highly available systems that meet customers’ reliability needs. This can sometimes happen in organizations that scale to a certain size or work in a way that does not heavily rely on research and innovation teams.

I mention this without an opinion because, at the end of the day, the business must continue to run. Having seen SLOs implemented in ways that blurred the line between monitoring and customer-centric reliability while lacking clarity surrounding how they fit into the organizations’ stories and thus long-term strategies, or how to use them, it seemed like the next best step. SRE, from an engineering perspective, helps to integrate what the engineer cares about versus what the customer cares about, in a way that creates metrics important to internal stakeholders and broader business needs. And here we are! Now let’s talk more about SLIs!

# SLIs-as-a-Service

SLIs-as-a-Service refers to the concept of providing tools, platforms, or consulting services that help organizations define, measure, and improve their SLIs. Rather than selling SLIs directly, this approach focuses on enabling teams to establish meaningful reliability metrics within their observability and monitoring frameworks. In a typical conversation, the focus can shift toward objectives. Although objectives are important, indicators and the metrics used to build them can have a negative impact on the objectives you set if designed incorrectly. This ties into the practice of observability and developing the level of visibility into systems that is needed to accurately base other reliability dependencies upon it. If you are not able to clearly observe and report on what is happening in your systems, then you will not be able to achieve optimal levels of reporting.

If your organization aligns its internal SLOs with external SLAs, it’s crucial to ensure that SLIs accurately reflect user experience. Misalignment between SLIs and SLOs can lead to incorrect reporting and impact SLA compliance. This will then lead you to believe SLIs and SLOs are not a useful practice, instead of realizing you are measuring the incorrect components and reporting metrics are out of alignment with long-term goals. You will sometimes realize that you do not have the required level of observability to begin to build customer-centric SLIs and SLOs that are meaningful to your organization. This rant is not the goal of the chapter but an important driver and thus worth mentioning.

Let’s think of service level measurements as a product, instead of a service we are trying to sell. With a typical product, a customer makes a one-time purchase, whether it is online or in person, and pays the allocated price. In addition, some products exist where the customer can make reoccurring payments, at some cadence and through a subscription. In other instances, a customer can also sign a contract and purchase a product where benefits such as a warranty, customer support, or another service are included for an allotted amount of time. This is ultimately how we want to think of and treat SLIs as a Service and focus on the concepts that make up the lifecycle.

# SLIs-as-a-S Product lifecycle

SLIs are generally referred to in software and technology throughout the book. In this chapter, we will shift the conversation toward software and technology product lines.

In the product world, for a product to go live and become generally available to the public, the product will go through a product development lifecycle. Once development has been completed, or asynchronously to some stage in product development, the product will also go through a **go-to-market** (**GTM**) strategy or cycle. At a high level, similar stages make up each cycle. The tasks that make up each stage and the strategic goal of the stage will differ between each lifecycle as one is centered around development while the other is marketing. We don’t want to reinvent the wheel but pull from each lifecycle the tasks and stages that align with shaping the service-level measurement as a product in and of itself.

## The software development product lifecycle

The product development lifecycle as it relates to software within the software and technology industry typically consists of seven stages, shown in *Figure 14.1*.

![Figure 14.1 – The 7 stages within the software development cycle](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_14_01.jpg)<br>
Figure 14.1 – The 7 stages within the software development cycle

Although it can vary from one organization to another, we’ll stick with the standard for this chapter’s purposes. As with various lifecycles and frameworks, it consists of several stages with tasks within each stage. Each stage is comprised of tasks that help the product transition from conception through to release, relating to technical development.

The standard product development lifecycle will consist of the following stages.

### Ideation

Development includes the period of ideation or conception through the technical development process in preparation for release. This typically includes an organization’s architects, designers, and engineering and product business groups, among various other business domains. Ideation is not limited to a specific framework but rather the best process used to help internal teams innovate in developing new solutions to address a current need or problem for the target audience.

This stage can also result in various ideas for a single solution that the team will triage to determine which is the best solution. Apart from that, a team’s triaging can result in the development of a **proof of concept** (**POC**) to test whether the idea can exist as a technical solution. This stage will shift the team in the direction of validating the business and technical requirements of the solution.

### Validation

Validation includes a series of processes, tests, and/or various other tasks used to validate a single or many ideations developed in the initial stage. In the product lifecycle, it can consist of surveying members of the targeted audience, interviews, and focus groups to assess which solution will perform better or confirm the solution aligns with the market need. Processes such as A/B testing are used to compare the benefits of two possible solutions. The best process for validation is the one that suits your organization and target market’s needs. There are numerous case studies and frameworks within the market that can be used.

### Prototyping

Once the team has internally validated the appropriate solution to the identified problem, it may make sense to prototype the solution or develop a proof of concept, as mentioned in this chapter’s initial ideation section. The POC is often completed during the ideation or conception stage. However, in some instances, the two are used interchangeably. It’s important to understand instances where they are used as two separate concepts. The POC is used to focus on the required processes to bring the product to life and its feasibility.

A prototype serves as a lightweight version of a product, allowing internal stakeholders and investors to evaluate its feasibility and alignment with reliability goals. When prototyping SLI-driven products and services, the focus should be on establishing the observability pipeline, defining key SLIs early, and ensuring that error budgets and alerting mechanisms can be tested before full-scale development.

The ideation process is also revisited to determine how to best bring the product to market. The prototype will include the key features integral to solving the identified problem. It also serves as an opportunity to complete another stage of validation to gather feedback and make several changes prior to development. It can serve as a point to validate the aesthetics of the UI if appropriate.

In an organization where a proof of concept and prototype are separate phases, let’s consider the following: we want a platform that ingests system architecture and operational data, then programmatically defines SLIs based on measured service performance and maps them to SLOs aligned with business objectives, integrating seamlessly with industry-standard SRE tooling.

#### Proof of concept

The immediate request for a system where we can enter information and data regarding the system and it completes the remaining work sounds a bit foreign to all parties involved. However, a similar request came from five key accounts and a few engineers thought a POC would get the ball rolling. They might do the following:

* Research and determine whether a product with this function already exists.
* Research and identify AI and ML technology and trends to determine whether there is a solution that exists.
* Consider other internal technical tooling and technology that exists.

Condense this information into some artifacts to market the technical feasibility to internal management.

#### Prototype

Once the team has determined the tooling and technical feasibility, they may want to shift toward building the prototype, which will help stakeholders visualize the product and realize its real-world usage and value. As previously mentioned, this stage will likely have all the features and functionality that are critical to its success and were likely mentioned at some point of engagement with the five key accounts that initiated the request.

Following the process in this stage of development, for some solutions, will help the team refrain from “scope creep” and successfully transition into pilot and production development for a product in alignment with the customers’ key use cases. This can also help to seamlessly and asynchronously begin the marketing and development stages.

### Marketing

Once the prototyping stage has been completed and various personas are developed, the attention can shift toward the marketing stages. As it relates to the text in this chapter, think of the strategic planning process of backcasting, where the future state is defined, here via POC, and the development work is completed. Although mentioned here, prior to development, we’d consider beginning the phase asynchronously with the development work and holding the development process accountable for delivering what we are marketing. This may not be suitable for all initiatives or even industries.

It is also equally important to revisit the concept of personas from [*Chapter 6*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/6). We can create personas based on the type, i.e., buyer type, user type, and so on. At this stage, the team should have a solid understanding of those types, along with the target audience. Please revisit concepts in [*Chapter 6*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/6) if needed. Your marketing strategy should incorporate enough data about targeted personas to further inform and shape your product during the development process.

When bringing a product to market, you’ll hear the term go-to-market and sometimes product-led growth as the strategy. Product-led growth utilizes the product specifically to “acquire, activate, and retain customers” (Bush, 2019) while inheriting GTM core principles. Although marketing is not the primary focus of this book, it is relevant in the context of positioning SLI/SLO-driven reliability as a marketable service. Organizations that offer reliability as a service, reliability consulting, or reliability engineering platforms can leverage SLIs and SLOs as core value propositions, ensuring that service levels reflect achievable reliability guarantees. If not, then many of the tasks can only help your team formulate ideal selling points when attempting to elicit internal investors and stakeholders.

Within the marketing space, the GTM strategy will consist of several stages, as with the development processes. We will not go into depth about each stage but will highlight the purpose of each. Stages of the GTM strategy may include the following, in chronological order:

* **Research**: Research the current market to develop insights regarding market needs and trends. This should also include competitor analysis to understand what competitors exist and what features and functionality will set your product apart. This stage may also include reviewing past customer engagements and key business accounts.

* **Design**: Design, as it relates to productizing SLIs and SLOs, centers around understanding what specifically you want to bundle. Conceptualization was likely done during the ideation stage, which leaves this stage of the process for focusing on packaging for the target market. Building data surrounding what additional features are needed to make this a competitive seller will help to guide this phase.

* **Build**: The build process as it relates to the context of this chapter relates to external documents and digital assets for product branding. This stage may also include content development for initial training, project plans, and customer-facing contracts, if necessary. Internally, it can include similar artifacts that help to run a successful workshop, training materials, and pre-work documents.

* **Pricing**: Pricing heavily relies upon what you decide to sell or market. If the organization plans to schedule reliability engineering workshops, they might be interested in a la carte pricing. If the organization is interested in an SLI/SLO platform, they may be interested in subscription or pay-as-you-go pricing plans. If there is ongoing support, the team may want to implement contracts providing specific services for a cost for an explicit amount of time.

* **Sell**: Depending on the size of the team, organization, or individual goals, what does the sales plan look like? Does it include sales enablement, which requires training and enablement documentation? If sales agents are in a mix of things, how do we incentivize sales agents? What feedback loops can we create between the sales channel and external customers? If we are externally selling our product, how do we utilize sales tactics to internally market and create buy-in among stakeholders and engineering teams? These are examples of questions that you’d need to answer to aggregate the appropriate data for this phase.

* **Monitor**: In the later stages of the process, there will come an improvement stage where everything is up and running. During the improvement stage, how do we monitor the impact the product has within the organization, or within the customer’s organization? The team may want to implement processes that tie into organization-wide KPIs and OKRs to better track improvements.

### Development

The development process can begin after the success of a POC or prototyping event. Depending on the structure of the internal team and organization, it can take place asynchronously with specific stages of the marketing lifecycle.

During the development stage, you will likely develop an **MVP**, or **minimal viable product**, that represents the final product with the minimum number of features required to attract early adopters and encourage the team to develop actionable insights from the adopters. This includes creating the necessary artifacts, such as product roadmaps and internal backlogs for product management capabilities and future iterations of features that may not have made it into the MVP version.

### Launch

The product launch is the period before releasing the product to the market. This might include social media advocacy, internet marketing ads, and various other communications to inform your target audience of the product’s general availability. During this stage, you’d want to focus on the release aspects of the product.

### Monitor improvements

The final stage is an ongoing and iterative process to monitor and identify gaps for improvement. This stage is dependent on the structure of the team and the internal workings of your organization. It includes the period where feedback is garnered through customers or users and implemented. This can be done via processes used in the earlier stages, such as interviews and surveys. More established organizations may have **NPS**, or **Net Promoter Score**, systems in place to capture customer temperature and feedback from using the system.

Despite the method used, it is important to capture data in a way that provides information related to the specific features of your product and actionable insights to respond to.

If your customer is an internal engineering team or business unit, you can still utilize similar processes that you’d implement for an external customer within the scope of your budget and resource allocation limits.

During this stage, you’d likely look at which users your product is attracting, what features they are most focused on, and what features they are requesting or submitting complaints about. This includes assessing your own team’s communication methods and strategies for product rollout. This will also include a reassessment of the artifacts created, such as product roadmaps and product management systems for backlogs to iterate on the features that were initially conceived.

Now that we have briefly reviewed the various stages of the product development lifecycle and go-to-market strategy based on a product-led organization, let’s focus on how we can use pieces of each lifecycle and transform service reliability into a product.

## SLIs and SLOs product lifecycle

Service level performance to ensure your technical solutions meet the expectations and needs of the customer is crucial to the success of your business. Since we have briefly reviewed the product and marketing lifecycle as it relates to products in the technology industry, it’s time to apply the lifecycle and processes to our SLI and SLO process, to understand how we can package it as a service for external customers and other internal engineering teams and related stakeholders, requiring customer-centric service level performance metrics.

As a brief reminder, it is important to understand that being sold internally does not mean your team or business unit is selling a tangible product to other internal teams. In some instances, if you are building a platform or application that solves a reliability engineering problem, this may be true. However, in the scope of this chapter, it is to foster a culture where if/when we decide to implement service level performance, we maintain a business mindset and encourage internal teams to increase their understanding of customer centricity from a business perspective.

To successfully achieve what was previously mentioned, we’d ideally consider and apply the necessary stages to the SLI and SLO ideated solution referenced in the upcoming sections. A high-level depiction appears in *Figure 14.2*.

![Figure 14.2 – A product lifecycle for packaging your SLIs and SLOs](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_14_02.jpg)<br>
**Figure 14.2 – A product lifecycle for packaging your SLIs and SLOs**

At the time of writing this, I am grateful for the opportunity to have partnered with organizations that offered reliability engineering capabilities through SLI and SLO enablement, SLI and SLO development, and SLO management platforms as a solution for internal and external customers. My initial experience with SLOs began as a part of a platform team providing enterprise support to development teams using our platform for container orchestration, application development, and DevOps tooling. As a part of the platform team providing support, SLO dashboards for incident and ticket management were a solution for us.

Adding to that, joining another organization and attending another staff engineer meeting with the customer support team looking for ways to improve ticket management fostered an interest in the fundamentals related to reliability engineering. I include this to say, although the book focuses on service level performance for application services and platform environments, do not limit the context in which SLIs and SLOs can be used to improve the technical logistics within your organization. This leads us into the initial stage of ideation within the suggested lifecycle for packaging and selling service-level performance capabilities as a service.

### Ideation/conception

During the ideation stage, it’s important to conceptualize what components of service level performance you are looking to implement or sell. This can vary from consulting services on various topics previously mentioned, where one would be creating and running workshops to authentically help an organization with the initial stages of establishing what system components to measure. It can also result in building a platform solution providing SLI and SLO management and reporting capabilities to other enterprise businesses with a need for specific measurements.

In the previous section, we referenced research as a part of the marketing stage. However, upon creating a POC of your proposed solution, if applicable, you may want to conduct market research to identify organizations within your target market that currently have the same or a similar solution. This will help to better develop features that set your product apart from the rest.

If marketing internally, it may be in your best interest to research with other engineering teams to identify what monitoring solutions they have in place, bottlenecks, and other blockers to ensure your ideation is in alignment with the needs of the broader organization. Another team may have sufficient data to develop actionable insights and be more than willing to act as a customer throughout the various stages. This, ideally, will also help to ensure alignment prior to development, which leads us into the development phase.

### Development

Once you, and your team, if relevant, can identify the capabilities that you would like to sell, you can then begin the development process. For this book’s purposes, we will not limit development to the technical aspects. Whether you are attempting to develop internally or externally, there will be requirements for documentation, eliciting internal system designs, and taking physical action to build the features identified during the ideation stages.

At this stage, we will not incorporate many of the GTM phases previously mentioned. However, there are a few that we want to consider during, prior to, or asynchronously with the development process. The phases we should include are as follows:

* **Marketing**: How do we market the product prior to it being released to the public, or even to internal teams? Is the solution an industry-related solution that requires marketing ads and social media advocacy? If the product is centered around internal engineering teams, what does the marketing strategy look like to increase the level of buy-in? Do we create short demos and tutorials?

  As a part of this process, it is also important to think about and consider the selling approach. Does it warrant a top-down or bottom-up selling strategy? Bottom-down strategies tend to work better within product-led environments and focus on the product marketing and selling itself through customers using it (Bush, 2019). On the flip side, a top-down selling strategy will foster buy-in and approval via the executive pipeline and require a different marketing and selling strategy. Each approach will likely have some level of impact on the pricing strategy, which leads us into the next phase.

* **Pricing**: The features your team decides to sell and the packaging decision will depend on the pricing strategy. Is this an ongoing service that customers can subscribe to? Does the team want to offer an a la carte menu? Are we building a platform with service functionality that provides pay-as-you-go or freemium tiers? If we are providing workshops to the customer, we may want to charge for the workshop. However, does the relationship end with the sale or are we offering the ability for customers to bundle additional services and improve the customer account churn rate?

  The structure of the organization and budget of the team implementation will greatly impact the decision-making process within this phase. In addition, the top-down approach places a greater burden on the sales team. Neither is better than the other. It is a matter of opting for the solution that provides the appropriate sales cycle and will align better with your target users’ needs and the future scalability of your customer base.

* **Sales**: If your customers are external facing and sales representatives or consultants are available, what does the ideal level of interaction with the customer look like? Does the business group or team have the budget to incentivize sales agents? Do we utilize the team as sales agents and perform demos or use proofs of concepts to attract early adopters and other future clients? Decisions made within this phase will help to set individuals not involved in the technical aspects of the product up for success.

### Launch

The launch period is heavily dependent upon the method you are using to productize your SLI and SLO process. This includes the decisions made during the marketing phase. We’d expect many of the items in the marketing phase to have been implemented in preparation for “flipping the switch” to go live.

Another key consideration in the go-live phase is ensuring robust incident response and monitoring processes. SLIs should be established to measure key performance indicators such as request latency, error rates, and availability. SLOs should define acceptable thresholds to trigger alerts when service reliability deviates from expectations. This ensures that issues are logged, managed, and resolved efficiently with minimal downtime. In the event we are rolling out a workshop, are there any on-site logistics that could heavily impact the success of the workshop? If the workshop is being conducted in a virtual environment, how do we ensure there are no technical blips in the virtual meeting room or with the collaborative tools we are accessing via the web? These are all questions that need to be asked to ensure a successful go-live and launch day.

### Monitor

Once the team has experienced a successful launch day or executed the first initial workshop, how can we better understand the value of the solution? What are the value metrics that will help to track this information over time to help customers and invested stakeholders understand the value? If we have a solid picture of the value that we hope or expect to bring, this offers the team a good starting point to understand what they need to monitor to start with. This is in addition to creating a solid foundation for maintaining increased visibility for iterating on what additional features to incorporate to continue to scale the solution.

The monitoring process does not merely include monitoring the technical features and implementations but also whether the product is meeting the needs of the customer. Remember, this is achieved through the initial development of the persona and persona journey to understand how components in the system work together to achieve an outcome for the ideal persona. If this is done as expected, our SLIs and SLOs should tell the expected story, help to establish a set of value metrics, and align the revenue model with the customer acquisition model (Bush, 2019).

At some point in this stage, we will pose a series of questions, such as the following:

* Is there a need to increase the capabilities and features of the system?
* Are customers satisfied and seeing a reduction in the number of problems that initially attracted them to our solution?
* Has implementation increased the ability of the customer to meet internal objectives, and thus short-term and long-term strategy goals?
* Are there processes in place that help to build this data and thus create actionable solutions to ensure we are solving problems that the customer is not immediately aware of?

There are various other questions to help formulate some hypothesis of the desired goals and shift the team in the direction of developing the processes to build and monitor the identified value metrics. Related to the text within this chapter, we might consider the following:

* The number of workshops scheduled within a month or a quarter, of which customers could implement SLIs and SLOs.
* The amount of revenue generated for a platform per annum.
* The monthly recurring revenue generated in a subscription environment.

Outside of the monetary aspects, if we are focused on the customer and metrics that help to gauge their behaviors and improve the customer experience, we’d consider the following:

* What is the customer acquisition cost as it relates to monetary and/or staff required to implement and maintain?
* Does the **customer lifetime value** (**CLV**) align with the numbers we are experiencing?
* What are the retention rates?
* Is there a positive correlation between newly released features and new adopters?

Apart from understanding how the product performs monetarily, we want to see a positive correlation between customer usage of the product and generating new customers, as well as low numbers in terms of customer churn. Your value metrics should help you to better understand how your product is performing, in addition to whether the way the team or organization is responding to the customer’s needs is sufficient.

# Summary

This concludes the discussion about creating an SLI and SLO sellable product. Although not the focus of the book, it is common to create a product or solution without the knowledge of how to bring it to market or how to internally garner the buy-in that is needed from the broader organization. This is especially common for individuals who might have the technical inclinations but not necessarily the business knowledge and execution to bring it to life. After reading this chapter, I hope your mind is stimulated in a way that brings about creative and innovative ways to contribute to the reliability engineering community, if for nothing more than to improve the reliability within your own teams and organizations.

Although this chapter concludes the book, it is only a single part of your journey with SLIs and SLOs. If you are just starting, I hope that it encourages you to get started in a structured and fun way. I hope that you couple this with other reliability engineering practices and materials to begin the transformation process within your organization.
