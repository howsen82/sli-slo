# Workshop Preparation: Structuring the SLI and SLO Conversation

In this chapter, we migrate toward the fun stuff. In [*Chapter 2*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/2), we explored the organizational and team aspects of implementing SLIs and SLOs within your organization. In [*Chapter 3*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/3), we defined and outlined personas and the customer journey as it relates to SLIs and SLOs. By understanding this process in its totality, we provide ourselves with an opportunity to ensure that our engineering teams clearly capture and understand our customers’ needs.

In doing so, we can accurately establish application boundaries to identify, implement, and prioritize SLIs, which, in turn, help define SLOs and monitor performance against SLAs to ensure stable reliability through appropriate metrics. This chapter’s goal is to outline the workshop’s structure before applying it. In the chapters that follow, we will apply these learnings to different applications and architectural settings to further demonstrate the previous chapters.

This chapter also highlights the significance of establishing application boundaries and will provide insights into identifying and categorizing critical applications and components.

We’ll be covering the following main topics:

* Developing customer-centric SLIs
* Defining system components for customer journey visibility
* Focusing SLIs on customer journey metrics
* Setting SLO targets and performance thresholds

Now, let’s get started!

# Developing customer-centric SLIs

Using a formalized process or framework will help structure your conversation with invested stakeholders, the engineering team, product managers, and other parties invested in SLIs and SLOs. This also helps to ensure that specific information and requirements are captured in a way that is easily translated into SLIs. At a high level, the previous chapters are condensed into a set of steps that will enable you to build your SLIs. It can be identified as follows:

1. Define and map personas and their journeys.
2. Identify your system boundaries.
3. Implement your SLIs.
4. Set SLO thresholds.

Before we actualize the process, let’s dive a bit deeper into what each step entails as well as a few things to consider that help to ensure we capture information in a way that resonates with you, the reader. In hindsight, the process was structured as a conversational workshop to ensure the requirements were captured in a consumable way. The goal of this chapter is not to guide you on the tooling to use; however, it is imperative to consider it initially, which will help facilitators and other staff capture the data in a consumable manner.

Just to ensure the correct context is considered, the following section outlines minimal terminology in the context that is used in this book. Much of the information that is gathered to formulate each category is collected during market and/or organization research and surveying.

Let’s take a moment to briefly review terminology to ensure there is an understanding as we discuss various topics throughout this chapter and the chapters to follow:

* **Persona**: Personas represent users or customers of your product or service, and are used to understand how SLIs and SLOs impact different user journeys and the overall user experience. The characteristics that describe a persona typically include a persona name, their role, and any other qualitative or quantitative information that helps to describe their role in interacting with your product or service.

* **User journey**: The user journey, or persona journey, is the series of steps the persona takes to achieve a specific outcome during interactions with your product or service. Typically, you will experience a one-to-one ratio between the journey and the series of steps to achieve a specific outcome.

* **Journey mapping**: Your journey map is the process of visualizing the steps a persona takes to achieve a specific outcome. A journey map, just like any other data visualization process, is depicted in various forms. Journey mapping, like personas, also comes in different types. This can also include the emotions and feelings of a persona regarding the journey or step(s) along the journey. It can be segregated in two ways:

  + **Multi-persona journey map**: A multi-persona journey map is just that – a journey that includes multiple personas on the same journey. This can happen if the emotions felt heavily influence the outcome and vary according to specific personas.
  + **Single persona map**: Single persona maps consist of a one-to-one ratio for a persona to a specific journey and outcome. This is what you will typically see or experience when using the process with an organization or business.

* **Scenarios**: A scenario is a brief description or story that provides additional insight as to why the persona is using the product or service to achieve an outcome, with a specific context. It also describes how the persona is doing it.

* **Touchpoints**: Touchpoints are important to the process as they showcase where the interaction with your product or service occurs. If we consider a single product that is sold in a storefront and online, the product could have been suggested through an employee, from another loyal customer brand, or a marketing ad. This initial method of interaction can greatly impact the customer experience. Touchpoints can have an impact on the persona’s emotions during a journey. This is important to consider during your research.

Now that we understand referenceable terminology as it relates to the text within this book, let’s start the conversation with starting points for defining a persona and persona journey.

## Defining and mapping personas and journeys

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the following:

* Defining personas
* Defining the user journey
* Outlining the process for mapping personas to their journey

Leverage the insights developed during the process, which will help define your SLIs and establish SLOs to align with user needs and expectations.

Developing personas and the user journey mapping process are both fundamental techniques used to understand the needs, motivations, and behaviors of users. Personas represent fictional characters that embody different user segments, while user journey mapping visualizes the end-to-end experience of users as they interact with your product or service. Both tools help organizations empathize with users, identify pain points, and design solutions that address their needs effectively.

### Process for defining personas

Defining personas involves conducting research, interviews, surveys, and analysis of available user data to create profiles that represent your target users. This process includes gathering demographic information, understanding user goals and challenges, and identifying common behaviors and preferences at different phases of their experience. By synthesizing insights from qualitative and quantitative research, organizations can develop personas that accurately reflect the diverse needs and characteristics of their user base. When probing your users or developing personas, you want to ask questions that help you to understand their needs, goals, and motivations. This should also include questions that help you understand why they behave or make a specific decision at a given touchpoint.

Let’s reference a simple cosmetics website that supplies different beauty brands to its male and female customer base. The customer success organization may want to not only evaluate the technical performance and availability of the website through SLIs but also set SLO targets to define acceptable levels of performance and availability that align with SLAs, to ensure contractual commitments to customers are met. The customer experience or interactions with the website might look something a bit like the depictions in *Figure 6.1* at a high level.

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_06_1.jpg)<br>
Figure 6.1 – A high-level display of a cosmetics website for various customer personas to place orders

You might take the following steps to develop your data, identify personas, and then build out their journey:

1. Submit a request to your customer support team to solicit product-related data:

   * Are we receiving customer inquiries regarding a specific product, brand, and so on?
   * Are customer requests/tickets related to products being sold or website performance and availability?

2. Reach out to your marketing team and retrieve data regarding products frequently and infrequently purchased, as well as information on industry-related products and competitors:

   * What are the top-selling products (makeup, hair, body, etc.)?
   * Who are the organization’s market/industry competitors?

3. Reach out to your customer success team and retrieve customer **Net Promoter Score** (**NPS**) data related to the customer experience:

   * What is the NPS for your customer support organization?
   * How does your organization’s NPS compare to identified market competitors?
   * Are there focus areas triggering a decrease in NPS?
     + Poor customer support?
     + Poor performing products?
   * Do we even have NPS or some other mechanism to measure the customer experience setup?
   * Are there internal mechanisms, such as surveys, in place to highlight loyal customers leaving or coming from a competitor?

4. Reach out to internal engineering teams to understand any technical implications that could impact product availability and sales:

   * What incidents are related to website uptime and availability?
     + What is the impact on products being available?
   * Are purchase orders being abandoned due to latency on specific web pages?

These references are merely hypothetical questions you’d want to consider as well as different channels you’d want to leverage to begin your data gathering process. Much of the information is typically gathered during facilitation sessions, internal or external surveying mechanisms, and data storage repositories that might already be in place internally. By utilizing the feedback provided, you might conclude that you want to focus on the following personas categories:

* B2B buyers
* User personas
* Customer personas

Persona categories are identified based on the ability of different personas to fall into the following categories to provide further characteristics or context surrounding the persona as it relates to your product or service. Persona categories are described as follows:

* **Proto personas**: These are personas based on market research that help businesses understand what the target market wants and needs.
* **Customer personas**: These are realistic representations of the target customer, which include additional information about the customer’s demographic, behaviors, and needs.
* **User personas**: These focus on the typical user of a product or service to help a business understand how the user interacts with their product or service.
* **Buyer personas**: These represent a target market for a product or service and help the business understand the needs and wants of a target market who both use and buy their products or service.

For demo purposes, let’s select the following personas, each from one of the persona categories and identified using the previous questions asked. Our list of personas to begin is as follows:

* B2B salesperson
* Loyal customer
* New customer
* CRM integration

We’ll include an integration for **customer relationship management** (**CRM**) to represent the customer experience and ensure we focus on the technical aspects of the website from a different consumer perspective. Just to ensure we are on the same page, a CRM system is simply a technical solution leveraged by a business, organization, or team to manage various customer relationships. It’s typical to hear the acronym associated with sales, customer support, and IT teams within an organization.

In this instance, you’d typically use a brainstorming tool to map this process out. Experience has acclimated me with virtual tools such as Miro and the standard whiteboard. In *Figure 6.2*, you’ll find a sample of what a virtual board might look like, which can be replicated on any whiteboard within an office.

![Figure 6.2 – SLI/SLO virtual template using Miro](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_06_2.jpg)<br>

Figure 6.2 – SLI/SLO virtual template using Miro

Whiteboarding or brainstorming aids to facilitate the conversation with more control while still providing a collaborative, communicative, and flexible environment. In our dashboard, we have the following categories:

* **Personas**: Fictional characters that represent a user or customer of your product or service.
* **Persona journey**: The journey, or series of interactions, a persona takes to achieve some outcome related to your product or service.
* **Expectations**: The expectations a persona has for a specific step or outcome. It is important the expectations are tied to some form of historical data.
* **SLI specification**: The specification describes what you want to measure without technical details.
* **SLI implementation**: SLI implementation incorporates the technical details surrounding how you are going to measure your SLI.
* **SLI prioritization**: SLI prioritization aids in prioritizing your SLIs for physical implementation according to business impact and feasibility.

We’ll use the preceding steps to work through a few SLI and SLO examples. SLO thresholds should be defined as part of the persona mapping process to ensure that expectations are measurable. By collaborating with historical data, the team should explicitly identify and document SLO thresholds during this phase to set clear performance objectives for each persona, which will guide the development of SLIs.

Based on our persona categories and prior data gathering, we have identified the personas in *Figure 6.3*.

![Figure 6.3 – Identified personas](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_06_3.jpg)<br>
**Figure 6.3 – Identified personas**

As a team, it is best to use a ranking system that is understandable and fair to you all to rank each persona according to criticality. The goal of this step is to identify and prioritize personas based on their impact on business-critical SLIs. The team should align personas with specific SLIs that directly affect the user experience and business outcomes, helping to prioritize personas that are most critical to meeting SLOs. Depending on the time allocated, a team might also want to work through all personas and develop an iteration process at a later stage.

## Mapping the user journey

Mapping the user journey is simply the process of visualizing the series of steps and touchpoints that users encounter when interacting with a product or service. This process helps organizations understand the context in which each persona engages with their offerings. It also helps to identify pain points and uncover opportunities for improvement. By mapping out the user journey, organizations can gain a holistic view of the user experience and prioritize initiatives that enhance usability, efficiency, and satisfaction accurately. This also raises awareness of the importance of including the tooling and different integrations as personas as well.

Under each sticky note (*Figure 6.5*), you will find a white dot. This dot reflects the personas we are going to move forward with. In an actual workshop, you’d want to set up some timing mechanism to allow for discussion as well as a voting process for the team to identify which personas are critical. It’s also important to note that this does not mean the remaining personas are complete. In fact, it is encouraged that the team stores this information in some repository that is accessible for a period. This allows the team to reflect on previous decisions made and iterate on any identified gaps or improvements.

In the context of SRE, decisions on persona prioritization and the journeys should be based on SLOs and SLIs rather than just historical data. For example, historical data can guide the team to identify critical personas based on the impact on user experience, but specific thresholds and indicators should be tied to measurable service levels. This only helps to solidify why the team made the decision and map any future issues to the decision. It’s easier to correct if we understand the “why.” With our persona journey and the next step in the process, we will update our virtual whiteboard with the personas in *Figure 6.4*.

![](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_06_4.jpg)<br>
**Figure 6.4 – Selected personas**

The goal of the persona journey, as previously mentioned, is to outline the series of steps that a person takes to achieve some outcome related to your product or service. It’s imperative that the team communicates and collaborates regarding the possible outcomes that a persona takes. Each outcome or workflow should be broken down with minimal dependencies on other outcomes and workflows to ensure better accuracy.

Hypothetically speaking, we have already migrated the prioritized personas we want to initially focus on. Remember, the remaining items are not being ruled out; we are merely starting with the personas that the team agrees, based on some historical data, are most critical to the business. Therefore, we identify that the following journeys that each persona attempts to achieve in our system are business critical, and if unavailable, the customer would notice. In other words, the following characteristics were taken into consideration to determine criticality:

* Importance to the business
* Importance to the customer
* Measurement or comparison of emotions

Our **Persona Journey** board would appear with the following personas and journeys:

* **B2B Customer**:
  + Successful bulk purchase of product “x”

* **Customer** – **Cart Abandoned**:
  + Successful purchase after leaving the purchase page

* **CRM Integration** – tooling:
  + CRM tooling sends confirmation of purchase
  + CRM creates an issue upon customer submission
  + CRM routes the customer inquiry to the appropriate team

* **Frequent Buyer**:
  + Buyer completes a successful purchase via website notification
  + Persona purchases items via marketing advertisement

* **Customer** – standard:
  + The website is available
  + The customer account is accessible
  + The product inventory is available

In *Figure 6.5*, the persona journeys are listed with the most critical journeys being marked with a white dot. This is the mechanism used to serve as a reminder of where the initial focus should remain. As mentioned previously, developing a ranking system and iteration process that works best for your team is extremely beneficial.

![Figure 6.5 – Identified personas](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_06_5.jpg)<br>
**Figure 6.5 – Identified personas**

Upon identification of our personas and their respective journeys, we need to focus on the expectations that the respective persona would have for a journey or specific touchpoints during the journey. It is also possible at this point that the team realizes that a journey needs to isolate some parts of the journey. That is okay and the purpose of communication and collaboration during the process. If we remember [*Chapter 3*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/3), *Figure 3**.3*, a customer journey card might look something like *Figure 6.6*.

![Figure 6.6 – An example of customer journey chart for an customer persona](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_06_6.jpg)<br>
**Figure 6.6 – An example of customer journey chart for an customer persona**

Depending on the working style or needs of your team or organization, the journey card may be classified as comprehensive documentation. I recommend you review the Agile Manifesto for more information (link available at the end of the chapter). A key value states, “*Working software over comprehensive documentation*” and “*Individuals and interactions over processes and tools*” (*Agile Manifesto, 2001*). This may or may not fit the culture of your organization but aligns with the workshop style outlined within this book. For this book and chapter, we will not focus as much on the map but will include a single example.

If we use the *Customer* persona for *Product Purchase* as an example, the customer journey would appear as depicted in *Figure 6.7*:

![Figure 6.7 – Customer journey mapping for the Customer Product Purchase persona](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_06_7.jpg)<br>
**Figure 6.7 – Customer journey mapping for the Customer Product Purchase persona**

Within both **Phase 2** and **Phase 4**, there are steps within the phase that can be utilized as a feature request if requested by the customer or internal data shows there is a necessity for it. In this instance, the journey map is helpful in visualizing potential gaps within the system that might need to be reported back to the product management teams or added to some backlog managed by the appropriate individuals in your SRE enablement team.

Occasionally, you’ll find other steps within a phase that are good candidates for SLIs if they are measurable and directly impact the SLOs. For example, the shipping ETA and tracking IDs could help us determine whether shipping partners are meeting their SLAs (e.g., delivery time promises) and whether the integration between the shipping feature and our website meets the required SLOs, such as returning the tracking number within a specific timeframe. In both instances, depending on the architecture of the system, there may be external dependencies if the SLAs of the shipping provider do not align with your process or discrepancies are on the shipping partner’s side. These are gaps that are easily identifiable through communication via the right individuals during the workshop.

Let’s stick with this example and move on to the next step in the process.

## Identifying your system’s boundaries

As it relates to reliability engineering, defining clear boundaries for applications and services is extremely important to support effective monitoring, maintenance, and optimization of your systems and services. In other scenarios and workflows, more people-oriented processes might take place, as they relate to personas. We’ll try to reflect that within this section as well. Therefore, it’s possible that the service you are providing involves a system but focuses solely on the behaviors of the persona.

You might be asking yourself what we mean by identifying a system’s boundaries. It’s the cumulative methods that are used to define where one system ends and another begins. This aids with the management process for validating, maintaining, and change management for systems or components. When doing so, we want to do the following:

1. Identify, define, and categorize critical components and dependencies.
2. Define clear boundaries.
3. Categorize or prioritize components as needed.

Let’s review what each of these means to our process in more depth.

### Identifying critical components and dependencies

Understanding the intricate architecture of applications involves identifying critical components and dependencies that contribute to overall system performance and reliability. By conducting thorough analyses and assessments, teams can pinpoint components that are essential for maintaining service availability, functionality, and performance, thereby guiding monitoring and optimization efforts.

In the *Figure 6.1* example, we will hypothetically consider the account service as a critical component since a user is unable to complete tasks outside of viewing products without the appropriate account access.

### Defining clear boundaries

Defining clear boundaries in the context of SRE involves understanding the interactions between components, services, and dependencies that contribute to service availability. It is crucial to set boundaries based on the SLOs for each component or service, ensuring that performance and reliability metrics are measured at each boundary to align with business goals. In other words, how does a set of components work together to achieve a desired outcome for the customer? We can refer to it as the touchpoints of components that expose a specific functionality to the customer.

We’ve concluded that the accounts service is one of our critical components in the previous section. The application website consists of an account service and account database that work together to provide a user’s account functionality on our website. We can conclude that an account system boundary exists and consists of each of the services related to functions that involve interacting with the user’s account. This includes services that enable the user to update their profile avatar, manage personal information, and various other tasks that are essential to account management.

We might then infer that our service includes the Java application and other binaries that make up the account management service and the backend MySQL database. Each of the services or components works together to create a workflow for a user to create, view, update, or delete their account profile. We should define a specific SLI for account creation, measure the success rate or latency of account creation requests, and establish a corresponding SLO that sets an acceptable threshold for the percentage of successful account creations within a defined time window (compliance period). This will help ensure the reliability of this critical functionality and track whether it meets the expected customer experience.

Clear application boundaries delineate the scope of monitoring and management efforts, enabling teams to focus resources efficiently. By defining boundaries, organizations can establish ownership, accountability, and responsibility for each application or service, facilitating streamlined operations and ensuring effective incident response.

### Categorizing and prioritizing applications

Categorizing applications based on business impact, customer needs, and technical complexity is essential for resource allocation and prioritization. By classifying applications into tiers or categories, organizations can tailor monitoring strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and prioritize incident response efforts based on the criticality of each application.

Let’s revisit our earlier example, which includes measuring the performance of creating, updating, or viewing the account profile. In the real world, where an organization is managing thousands and sometimes millions of microservices or applications on top of infrastructure, this can end up being the least of concern to the organization. However, degradation of specific functionality within the account can have a substantial negative impact on the business, such as:

* Backend payment management and security
* Measuring the availability of the infrastructure hosting the applications and services
* Security, as it relates to the reduction of security and data breaches

The preceding can play a more integral role in the organization’s reputation, as the lack of concern can have a much larger consequence when things go awry. Therefore, it is important for teams to understand what critical means to the team and business groups as it relates to the broader organization’s strategy and mission regarding meeting customer expectations.

Clarifying the role of each component and the responsibilities each has in meeting the expectations of the customer through some workflow within the system, the next step should naturally move the team toward the discussion of what we want to measure. Let’s continue to the next section to explore this concept a bit further.

# Defining system components for customer journey visibility

We already understand that our SLIs are the vital metrics we use to gauge the reliability, availability, and performance of our systems and services. Understanding the key metrics and indicators used to measure system reliability is fundamental for effective SLI identification. Metrics such as latency, error rates, throughput, and availability serve as essential indicators of system performance and user experience. It’s important to understand that the specification step should focus on defining the SLO for the critical workflows within the system, ensuring that these objectives are measurable and achievable. This step sets the baseline for what success looks like from the customer’s perspective and how it will be tracked through specific SLIs.

If we refer to our earlier example related to actions a customer can take against the account service, we’ll need to gauge what performance and success look like to the customer. Do they have issues with the speed of the page loading? Is data within the account consistently outdated or incorrect? Have they received external alerts from their security provider referencing their email, password, or payment method being made available through a breach? Ultimately, what “things” do we need to measure, and at what “cadence” do we need to measure them? This is the goal of the specification step.

In addition, if your team is not sure where to start, it is always a good idea to consider the four golden signals that are typically used for monitoring distributed systems. According to Google’s SRE Book, “*If you can only measure four metrics of your user-facing system, focus on these four*.” (SRE Book, 2017). The signals are as follows:

* **Latency**: The duration of time when a request is waiting to be handled.
* **Traffic**: A measurement of the demand or workload(s) placed on your system.
* **Errors**: The measurement of failed requests.
* **Saturation**: The capacity measurement of your system – how “full” it is.

Your SLIs can encompass a variety of metrics that reflect different aspects of system behavior and performance. Other types of SLIs include the following:

* **Throughput**: The measurement of the amount of information a system can process within a given period.
* **Availability**: The measurement of a system’s ability to perform its intended functions for users when needed. Availability includes the operation state of services that directly impact end user experience, and a system is considered unavailable if the user-facing services are down, even if other internal services are operational.
* **Uptime**: The percentage of time a system is operational and available to meet its SLA commitments. Uptime specifically refers to the system’s overall ability to be online but does not guarantee that all individual services within the system are available.
* **Response time**: The measurement of the total time it takes from a client request to the system and the return response.
* **Durability**: The level of protection data is from being corrupted or lost over a given period.

Each type offers unique insights into system reliability and user experience. Understanding the relevance of each type of SLI to different types of applications is essential for selecting indicators that accurately reflect system performance and user satisfaction. It’s also important to remember the process of identifying and defining SLIs involves aligning metrics with application boundaries and user needs.

## Considerations for selecting meaningful SLIs

Selecting meaningful SLIs requires careful consideration of factors such as relevance, actionability, and alignment with business objectives. SLIs should be selected based on their ability to provide actionable insights into system health, facilitate timely decision-making, and support organizational goals. By choosing SLIs that are meaningful, relevant, and aligned with business objectives, organizations can effectively monitor and optimize system performance to meet user expectations and drive business success.

To achieve the goals previously mentioned, we need to understand how what we are trying to measure and at what cadence can be mapped to the current technical architecture. Is the current logging system providing sufficient data insights in logging for us to measure what we need? Is the current logging system subpar and in need of improvement? Is there an opportunity to probe for synthetic data or even innovate and build into the product some feature that helps to achieve the expectation of the customer? Let’s continue to the implementation step to better understand how we can achieve this goal.

# Focusing SLIs on customer journey metrics

Implementation, as it relates to SLIs, focuses on understanding the technical grouping of the underlying components and how they work together to meet the expectations of the customer, through a workflow or piece of functionality. This is a crucial step in the process, enabling organizations to monitor, measure, and optimize system performance with increased efficiency as it relates to the customer experience. The implementation portion shifts the focus of the conversation toward how we measure the outcome we have identified.

If we refer to the example in the previous specification sections, we might want to begin the conversation with an understanding of where we can retrieve the information to answer and address the hypothesis of the information in the specification step. In other words, is the current system architected in a way that provides us with the information we need to measure performance? Do we currently have a metric system that provides the level of observability through monitoring, to create the algorithms needed to measure customer experience? Do we need to build upon what is currently in place to provide more robust capabilities?

Based on the outcome of the previous questions, how do we then determine the threshold of decreased performance before the customer notices? Before the customer submits a ticket? Before chaos ensues? The implementation stage should help the team establish clear SLOs and set thresholds that reflect acceptable levels of performance. These thresholds should define what “normal” system behavior looks like in terms of user experience and guide the team in identifying when the system is at risk of violating these objectives, triggering alerts for actions based on predefined SLOs.

## Establishing baseline values and thresholds

Establishing baseline values and thresholds for SLIs is essential for tracking performance and detecting anomalies within the context of SLA. Baseline values serve as benchmarks for normal system behavior, while thresholds define the acceptable ranges of performance aligned with the SLA’s commitment to the customer. These thresholds trigger actions when the system’s performance is outside the acceptable SLA range. Organizations must set realistic thresholds based on historical data, user expectations, and business objectives to ensure effective SLI monitoring and alerting.

# Setting SLO targets and performance thresholds

Setting SLOs based on SLIs is crucial for ensuring the team or organization captures performance from the customer’s perspective. SLO thresholds can be gauged through the following:

* Researching through historical data to understand past performance.
* Creating synthetic data to gauge current normal system performance.
* Utilizing internal engineering and support team data, including support tickets and incident management systems.
* Configuring SLIs and monitoring them over some period to establish a baseline value.

Your SLO thresholds can be configured via two methods. The two main methods at the time of writing this are as follows:

* **Request-based**: SLOs that focus on successful requests within a period calculated via a percentage.
* **Windows-based**: SLOs that measure based on a window of time or a time interval.

Which timing method is utilized is heavily dependent on the goal of the indicators the team is trying to create and the ultimate customer experience story you want to tell. Upon doing so, there should exist a baseline for understanding how each impacts the bottom line of the business and the ability to prioritize accordingly, which leads us into our next section.

## Importance of prioritizing SLIs

Prioritizing SLIs ensures that organizations focus on monitoring the metrics that are most critical to user satisfaction and business success. It helps to shift the focus of resources and efforts on the metrics that have the most significant impact on user experience and business objectives.

By identifying and prioritizing SLIs based on their impact on user experience, organizations can allocate resources effectively, prioritize improvement initiatives, and mitigate risks that could affect service reliability and performance.

Customer feedback provides valuable insights into the metrics that are most important to users, while business priorities help align SLIs with organizational goals and objectives. Risk assessment involves evaluating the potential impact of SLIs on service reliability, performance, and reputation.

## Establishing SLOs based on prioritized SLIs

Once SLIs have been prioritized, the organization is able to establish SLOs to set measurable targets for reliability and performance. Often, these can stem from or be used to reference external SLAs in an **anything-as-a-service** (**XaaS**) environment, ensuring that SLOs align with contractual commitments made to customers. SLOs will enable the team to define acceptable levels of performance for each prioritized SLI, providing clear goals and benchmarks for monitoring and optimization efforts. Acceptable SLO thresholds define the point at which service degradation becomes noticeable to customers, leading to potential dissatisfaction or operational issues.

By aligning SLOs with prioritized SLIs, which drives meeting SLA goals, organizations can effectively measure and track progress toward meeting user expectations and business objectives. Through diligent SLI prioritization practices, organizations can enhance service reliability, optimize performance, and drive business success.

SLI prioritization is an iterative process that constantly evolves based on the changing business needs, user feedback, and market dynamics. Organizations must continuously review and adjust SLI prioritization to ensure alignment with evolving priorities and objectives. By soliciting feedback from invested stakeholders, monitoring changes in user behavior, and reassessing various risk factors, organizations can refine SLI prioritization to reflect current realities and future opportunities.

# Summary

Implementing SLIs and SLOs requires careful planning, collaboration, and alignment with user needs and business objectives. By defining personas and understanding the user journey, establishing clear application boundaries, and identifying, implementing, and prioritizing SLIs, organizations can effectively measure and ensure the reliability, availability, and performance of their systems and services. Through continuous monitoring, analysis, and iteration, organizations can drive improvements in reliability and deliver exceptional experiences to their users.

In the chapters that follow, we will dive deeper into and utilize the learnings and processes from this chapter in a more robust manner. We will reference the same architecture but expand on the infrastructure and workload deployments a bit more to provide an improved scope.
