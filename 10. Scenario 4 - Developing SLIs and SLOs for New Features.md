# Scenario 4: Developing SLIs and SLOs for New Features

This chapter focuses on developing SLIs and SLOs for new features within your current system. Despite how available the system is, customers will always have new and changing needs, resulting in a requirement for new features. We can also assume the customer is going to expect enhancements to current features and other improvements within the system as time goes on. How do we then incorporate SLIs and SLOs for new features to report on their availability and performance? Additionally, how do we define and measure the reliability of new feature rollouts using the appropriate SLIs, such as the percentage of successful requests or feature adoption rates across targeted user segments? How do we then strategically decrease downtime and outages that impact long-term objectives? You can expect the answers to these questions in the sections that follow.

In previous chapters, we focused on centering service level measurements around other areas within a system’s architecture. The goal of this chapter is to shift the focus and narrative to adding new features that may have developed during the workshop session, from external customer requests, or by simply iterating through your product backlog. The overall goal remains the same: to provide you and your team with a starting point for developing service-level measurements within your organization.

This chapter covers the following topics:

* Application architecture
* Creating personas and the persona journey
* Identifying application (system) boundaries
* Specifying SLIs
* Implementing SLIs
* Prioritizing SLIs by business impact

We will follow this flow throughout this chapter and focus on new functionality and feature improvements for our hypothetical system. With this in mind, let’s get started!

# Application architecture

In the previous chapter, we introduced a simple website that offers products to individual customers making a purchase and businesses looking to purchase products in bulk for resale. We’ll continue with this example and scale it to include infrastructure and additional availability zones.

In previous chapters, we highlighted the overall architecture. In this chapter, we will not focus on the overall architecture but simply on the process as it relates to the new feature. The application and platform architecture are depicted in *Figure 10.1*.

![Figure 10.1 – Multi-region architecture](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_01.jpg)<br>
Figure 10.1 – Multi-region architecture

For additional information or application references, you can refer to [*Chapter 6*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/6). For now, the referenced architecture has been provided here as a refresher.

# Creating personas and the persona journey

At this point in the book, you will be familiar with what a persona is, persona types, and the persona journey. In this section, and sections to follow, you can expect to work through the process for adding new features and determining how to do the following:

* Build and implement SLIs and SLOs for new features.
* Implement SLIs and SLOs that cater to the usability of the system as it relates to the functional purchasing process versus the technical process in the system.

If we revisit the personas and persona journeys from *Chapters 6* through *9*, we navigated through the application and platform architecture to select the critical personas and their respective journeys through the system. During the persona and journey mapping process in [*Chapter 6*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/6), we identified two expectations that could potentially exist as new features of the system. At a high level, the feature requests were as follows:

* A guest account workflow used when a customer is checking out:

  + As a customer, I want to create an account.
  + As a customer, I want to log in to my account during the checkout process so that I can add personal information.
  + As a customer, I want to check out as a guest without logging in to or creating an account.
  + Additional method of payment:
    - As a paying customer, I want to make a purchase using accounts other than a debit and/or credit card (e.g., Google Pay, Apple Pay, Shopify, PayPal).

* Additional email notification regarding the date of arrival once the product is shipped:
  + As a paying customer, I want to receive a secondary email once my product has shipped, related to the predicted time of arrival.

* Measurement of custom application SLIs, such as request latency and error rates, using custom metrics exposed via `metrics.k8s.io`:
  + As an internal engineer, I want to measure the performance of custom metrics.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The initial request is related to aggregated custom metrics.

Now that we have a better understanding of the customer requests from previous chapters, we can shift toward fleshing out the personas and their respective journeys in the systems.

## Personas

To ensure that we understand the definition of each persona, let’s consider the following short descriptions as refreshers for each persona:

* **Customer purchase**: The customer purchase persona identifies as a customer who is making a typical purchase from the business website.
* **Shipping service**: The shipping service persona represents the shipping service deployed to the cluster that interacts with an external third-party service to provide details regarding product shipment.
* **Metrics service**: The service deployed to the cluster.
* **Buyer method of payment**: The buyer can make a purchase via multiple third-party payment methods (Google Pay, Apple Pay, Shopify, PayPal, etc.).

Based on the high-level expectations identified from the prior chapters, we can now update our visual dashboard to display the respective personas, which will help move us into establishing the respective journeys, as depicted in *Figure 10.2*.

![Figure 10.2 – New feature personas based on persona type](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_02.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.2 – New feature personas based on persona type**

As we shift toward defining the persona journey further for customers and other types of users, we also want to consider metrics that measure engagement, completion, feedback, and other experience-related workflows. When considering service-level measurements, it is easy to focus on the technical details. However, there are various other customer-centric measurements that help to capture experience-related details. We hope to highlight them within this chapter.

Following the brief descriptions that aid in providing an improved understanding of what each persona means on our visual board, we want to investigate, through collaborative discussion, the various workflows a persona can take in attempting to achieve an outcome within the system. *Figure 10.3* depicts the user journey for the respective persona.

![Figure 10.3 – New feature persona journey based on new features requested by customers](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_03.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.3 – New feature persona journey based on new features requested by customers**

By the team maintaining effective communication with design engineers and product managers, regarding historical information related to feature requests, we are able to immediately capture the initial user stories and several other technical documentation artifacts surrounding the new implemented features. The details were mentioned in previous sections.

The next step in the process is to flesh out the details surrounding what the customer expects versus the technical architectural details. This shifts us into the expectations chart within the visual board. The *expectations* section of the discussion helps the team define measurable SLOs based on customer expectations, such as response time, success rate, and frequency of service interactions, to measure the system’s performance. This helps to transition to a smoother path for mapping these expectations to the different system boundaries in the next phase. Based on the discussion, we define the customer expectations of the selected journeys as follows:

![Figure 10.4 – Updated journey expectations](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_04.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.4 – Updated journey expectations**

We might find ourselves discussing several aspects of the journey as it relates to how the new feature was implemented within the system. We might also discuss what the customer experience has been or what feedback was provided to gain a better understanding of customer sentiment regarding what is realistically occurring within the system. In addition, like in previous chapters, sorting through the workflow will only help to better understand how the underlying components are working together to achieve the ultimate end goal. In this instance, you might also find yourself answering some of the SLI specification questions as you get more comfortable moving through the process.

### Create an Account – At checkout

To better showcase an example, let’s use the *Create an Account – At Checkout* journey and walk through the process. Based on *Figure 10.4*, we have already identified the following related to the workflow.

**Description**: The business’ “new” customer base requested a feature where they can check out; enter all personal, payment, and shipping information; and end with the option of creating an account. Previous functionality created the account prior to submitting the information; however, it caused broken links during the process and did not always log in to the account after creating the new account, which led to information not being collected and stored. Customers were finding themselves having to go through the account creation again afterward, without having a suitable link to the order and personal information. The current workflow is depicted in *Figure 10.5*.

![Figure 10.5 – Account Creation – After Checkout workflow/persona journey](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_05.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.5 – Account Creation – After Checkout workflow/persona journey**

Based on the workflow and discussion, the team identified the following steps or phases within the journey, based on the assumption that the customer has completed shopping online and added all necessary items to their virtual cart. They are now at the point of following this workflow consisting of four dependent phases:

* **Phase 1** – The customer selects the **Checkout** button after placing all items in their virtual shopping cart:
  + We assume that the customer has placed all necessary items in the cart.
  + We assume the customer does not have an account and therefore is not logged in to an account.
  + We assume, since they have no account, that their email account is not associated with any accounts in the internal database.

* **Phase 2** – The customer is redirected to a **Purchase confirmation** page where they can add and/or remove any items, and then confirm they want all items remaining within the cart. They then can select **Create** **an account**:
  + We are assuming there were items added to the cart and still in the cart.
  + We are still under the assumption that the customer has not logged in to the account, nor do they have one.
  + We assume they selected **Create** **an account**.

* **Phase 3** – The page continues the purchase workflow instead of redirecting to solicit credentials and other account information. The customer enters personal, shipping, and payment information:
  + We assume they selected **Create an account** instead of other options.
  + We assume the customer has entered the correct information as it relates to procuring their product.
  + We assume the purchase process successfully completed after the payment was accepted.
  + We assume an order number and confirmation number are provided to the customer and displayed on their screen. (An email is sent to the customer; however, this is not important to this step.)

* **Phase 4** – Customer selects **Next** to redirect and input the email (username) and password to complete account creation:
  + Assumes the customer selected **Next** on the order and confirmation page.

In the preceding diagram, we did not include a phase 5. However, it is important to mention that we could have included the following:

* **Phase 5** – Customer selects **Submit** and is redirected to the newly created account home page:
  + Assumes all information entered meets the required length and format.
  + Assumes the button is available.
  + Assumes the customer can click the **Submit** button.

Our diagram would then depict the additional phase and provide a more accurate depiction of the workflow, as shown in *Figure 10.6*. The workflow is highlighted in this manner to showcase the possibility of missing a step within a workflow when merely talking through it or not referencing architectural diagrams. This can result in a significant change to the underlying metric or measurement. See the following for the inclusion of phase 5.

![Figure 10.6 – Account Creation – After Checkout workflow/persona journey incorporating redirection after clicking the Submit button in the UI](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_06.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.6 – Account Creation – After Checkout workflow/persona journey incorporating redirection after clicking the Submit button in the UI**

In addition, we can highlight an example of identifying a possible new feature during the discussion. Let’s use the redirection to the newly created account home page. We can easily argue there is a lack of security in place here, if a customer places a one-time order using someone else’s email address. The team would be interested in implementing the following:

* While security is critical, this feature also impacts availability and user experience. Therefore, introduce an SLO for the feature to ensure a balance between security and usability:
  + For example, the team may also consider implementing an activation link so the customer must log in to the account and confirm that the email belongs to them, as well as the account being created by the owner of the email.
  + To ensure a seamless user experience, we could define an SLO where 99.9% of account activation links should be delivered within 30 seconds.
* Redirect to a login page, if there is no activation link, and request that the customer logs in with the newly created credentials to access the account that contains personal and payment information.

Since the goal of the workshop is to outline the process and foster communication regarding features and functionality where we want to measure performance, we should define relevant SLIs, such as checkout page load time and time to complete account creation. Ideas such as this can be added to the “parking lot” for later triaging, ensuring performance tracking aligns with reliability goals. As the team further develops and acclimates to their own process, it may be beneficial to have a product manager included in the discussion who is able to manage and add items to the product management or engineering backlog. For the purposes of this chapter, we will continue to the next section and begin to familiarize ourselves with how the workflow maps to the underlying services and data layers.

# Establishing application (system) boundaries

Previous chapters have highlighted that once we have identified the critical personas and persona journeys, we want to then triage the persona journeys in a way that helps us to better understand the application logic. This includes other backend and platform components to gauge how they work together to achieve an end goal. In the previous section, we focused on a single persona journey, *Account Creation – After Checkout*, for the customer persona.

Let’s shift our attention to understanding the workflow as it relates to completing a product purchase when completed by two different customer personas. This will help us to understand which microservices work together to create the workflow. We need to first ask ourselves the following:

* What is it that we need to measure?
* Where do we need to measure it?
* Are there metrics currently available that capture items established on answering the prior two points?

Considering we are working within the remaining system, the team is already aware that we have the necessary information and various design and architecture documents to help understand the flow of backend components deployed within the cluster. Let’s start by revisiting our handy sequence diagram to understand the flow and then break down some of the underlying application components if necessary. Depicted in *Figure 10.7* is our product purchase sequence diagram, explained in *Figure 7.7* of [*Chapter 7*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/7).

![Figure 10.7 – Depicting the product purchase sequence of Chapter 7](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_07.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.7 – Depicting the product purchase sequence of Chapter 7**

In the diagram, there are no references to the creation of an account or guest checkout due to the focus of the discussion being on the purchase process for a customer who already has an account. If we consider the flow as it relates to a customer without an account, wanting to make a purchase, it will appear as in *Figure 10.8*.

![Figure 10.8 – Account Creation – At Checkout sequence diagram](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_08.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.8 – Account Creation – At Checkout sequence diagram**

In [*Chapter 7*](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/cloud-and-networking/9781835889381/7), we neglected to include the steps for the checkout option; however, in the process, it did not necessarily impact the main discussion points as we were focusing on accounts that were already logged in. However, depending on the flow, functionality, and architecture of a system, this could drastically impact the accuracy of the indicators and objectives you are measuring, resulting in inaccurate reporting against your SLOs, which in turn may affect compliance with your SLAs.

While many teams, organizations, and individuals may disagree, documentation and technical writers are extremely important where they can be supported. They can better aid in legacy and other historical information, as well as with iterative approaches where knowledge sharing among various individuals and roles is a must. This is not within the scope of this chapter but is important to keep top of mind. Let’s now focus on the specification process.

Bookmark

# SLI specification

The purpose of the specification process is to help the team work toward developing an understanding of “what” they want to measure, without the technical details. In previous chapters, we focused on critical journeys and identified SLIs for those journeys that were critical despite the persona journey. In this chapter, we will focus on a single journey and identify SLIs specific to it that provide the ability to report on performance or some other critical metric.

For the *Create an Account* persona journey, we can refer back to the expectations and journey chart to identify key pieces of functionality that happen between the microservices that are critical to the overall success of the workflow. Functionality referenced in previous sections of the book included the following:

* Successfully being able to click the **Create an account** button to create an account.
* A new account successfully being created.
* The new account populating and successfully redirecting to the home page, after credentials have been submitted.
* Customer information gathered during the purchase process being cached and written in the new account service after creation.

This provides the team with more than enough data points to leverage and improve the customer experience. We can then structure each piece of functionality in a way that assigns the function a name and SLI type, as depicted in *Figure 10.9*.

![Figure 10.9 – SLI specification with SLI types](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_09.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.9 – SLI specification with SLI types**

Based on the previous discussions and descriptions, the team decides that there are a few areas to further synthesize that will aid with determining the performance levels of the create an account functionality.

Let’s review the following persona journeys to better understand the new features and SLI types to develop additional insights for understanding what we should measure:

* **Data Cache: Data Retrieval** – As part of the new account creation feature, improvements were made to the data cache system to better fulfill data retrieval when a customer selects **Create an account** at the point of completing the purchase and submitting new credentials. Upon submitting new credentials, the information entered during the purchase process is captured and retained to store in the account database without having to redirect back to the order database to fulfill the request:
  + **Timeliness**: To better improve the availability of data, it’s best to capture the timeliness or the lag between when data is entered versus when it is being written.

  Timeliness is an SLI type that exists but was not referenced in the SLI type chart mentioned in other chapters. It’s important to have conversations with others, thinking outside of the box and capturing several SLI types and performance metrics, to ensure that we do not isolate our thinking to those mentioned in the list.
* **Home Page Redirection** – The timeliness SLI type, associated with the creation of an account, is focused on capturing the timeliness of redirecting the consumer’s request from the order fulfillment page, where credentials are also captured, to the home page of the newly created account after credentials have been submitted. Considering improvements were made to the cache system, and data read and writes will occur potentially across regions and between different backend services, the team would like to ensure the redirections occur within a certain amount of time and with accuracy:
  + **Latency**: Captures the time it takes for a request to be processed from end to end, from initiation to response, typically measured as request-response time or tail latency (e.g., 99% latency) to account for worst-case performance scenarios.

  If we refer to the previous section, where we mentioned an external customer being able to select **Create an account** to submit information and the account being created on the backend, the time it takes for the account to be created, given fields and values are entered according to build in policy, is the period for fulfillment.

  In this instance, we want to focus on this process as it relates to the cache system: the point where data has been entered, via the purchase process; written into the cache system; and retrieved after the purchase is completed, credentials are provided, and it is submitted so data can be written into the account backend.
* **Data Cache: Data Processing** – Within any cache system, there are metrics specific to gauging performance. To ensure that the speed of data caching enables fulfilling incoming requests, the team will focus on the cache hit ratio, which captures the ability of the cache system to fulfill user data requests without passing the request off to the origin server. In this instance, we understand the order service will capture the information from the customer, and the cache system will ensure this data is available for the account service to capture at the end of the purchase process.
* **Correctness** – Another important aspect when handling data is having a validation mechanism in place. Due to the underlying architecture, it is important to capture and validate the correctness of data:
  + In this instance, and in reference to handling the data cache, we will focus on version-based invalidation, or what is also known as validating on access.
* **Error Rate** – Capturing errors will help the team to pinpoint an area of focus when some leg in the workflow fails. We can think of this metric as simply capturing a request that failed. This is important for gaining better visibility of data reads and writes, as well as the failure of any other component.

Each of the identified areas will provide the team with a good starting point to effectively gauge the customer experience of the new changes surrounding creating an account during a purchase within the customer portal. We can now shift our focus toward implementation to better understand what processes we have in place to capture the metrics and information related to each component; we need to measure service performance in a way that captures the customer experience.

# SLI implementation

The purpose of the implementation process is to help the team work toward developing an understanding of “how” they want to measure the “what,” and “where” it is best to measure it. It simply incorporates the technical details into the specification process, as we have done in the previous sections. This prevents the team from jumping directly into the technical details, shifting the focus on monitoring what is more important to the engineering team versus what is important to the customer base and experience.

Now, let’s work a bit backward here and start with the implementation details, which incorporate information from the specification process. In the product world, this would be considered back-casting. Back-casting, in product management, is where we define the desirable future or end goal and then work backward to identify the steps and processes the team or individual needs to take to achieve it. This process is beyond the scope of this book but explains how we are handling this step, which is different from the previous chapters. *Figure 10.9* depicts the ideal end goal.

![Figure 10.10 – Create an Account implementation depicting the end goal of our SLI/SLO definitions](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_10.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.10 – Create an Account implementation depicting the end goal of our SLI/SLO definitions**

Hypothetically speaking, we’ve implemented a new caching system and configuration method to handle data transactions during the account creation process in a way that best serves our internal process. We will term this data gathering (caching) during the purchase process to then pass the information along to the account service to ensure the customer is not requested to enter the same data twice and data is captured at the end of the process.

In our current architecture, we know from previous chapters that logging is enabled at the application and infrastructure layers. We also know that we have event logging enabled at the container orchestration layer through our Kubernetes Deployment. Much of the event information as it relates to the applications will exist in the `kubelet` component deployed within each node in the cluster. We should keep this in mind as we flow through the implementation of each item of the specification process.

In previous chapters, we focused on application services and their backend databases, as well as container orchestration components deployed in clusters within a multi-regional cluster setup. Here, we are going to zone in on the web application component and focus on the cache process and home page redirection.

*Figure 10.11* displays the data process as it relates to caching for the account service. A service, the account service in this instance, sends a request to the backend database to request some data. The database service will then send a response to the application to provide that information to the appropriate application or UI for the end user.

![Figure 10.11 – Account application request and response to the account database](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_11.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.11 – Account application request and response to the account database**

The cache system integrates in the middle of the request/response process to ensure data is available for faster read/write transactions due to not having to send the request to the origin server, as shown in *Figure 10.12*.

![Figure 10.12 – Account application request and response via the cache system](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_12.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.12 – Account application request and response via the cache system**

Our main goal is to capture performance, and to ensure data reads and writes at various stages are successful and occur within the specific cadence, including during peak hours. The cache system ensures this happens at a faster pace. Therefore, it’s important to capture aspects of speed, success, and correctness as it relates to data.

## Data cache timeliness

The main goal of the cache system within the workflow is to focus on making data accessible at a rapid speed so that the following is achieved:

* It is captured correctly
* It is saved efficiently
* It is retrieved quickly
* It is safely copied

This ensures the data entered by the end user is captured, saved, retrieved, and copied from the order database within the account database. This should occur within a time frame that is reasonable to the customer when making a request. Initially, the team did not have a metric to gauge performance. However, if we view the timestamps within both services’ application and database logs, the team can gauge the approximate time it takes to complete the respective task.

In our web application, we know that on average, it takes the customer approximately five minutes, from end to end, to submit all fields with accurate information. We also know we have the **Time to Live** (**TTL**) configured at 10 minutes due to previous complaints from external customers regarding web page refreshes when breaking from the page. The team might decide to stick with the current TTL configuration, as a constraint, but the actual SLI should measure the percentage of successful data writes completed within a predefined latency threshold, for example, 99% of writes within a 600-second (about 10 minutes) period.

## Home page redirect latency

The main goal of the home page redirect latency SLO is to ensure that 99.9% of user redirections occur within 3,000 ms. Once a customer places an order, a confirmation page is displayed. The page provides the opportunity for the customer to create a new account, retrieving details from the order process and storing them in the new account. At this step, the customer is only required to enter the credentials to perform the account creation process.

It is important to not confuse redirection at this stage with the customer receiving a `301` or `308` response code. The focus in this phase is on creating an account with the supplied credentials and retrieving cached data from the respective database to provide to the account process to create a new account for the customer. It is not an error that needs addressing.

We can think of this step here as utilizing conditional HTTP headers to route the request. If the customer supplies credentials and opts to create a new account (conditions are met), then the data from the order is retrieved and used to populate the new account. This removes additional requirements for the customer to reenter data later.

## Data cache correctness

When working toward determining data correctness, it can prove to be a bit more difficult. However, let’s pretend the team agrees that although fast data processing is ideal, it should not occur at the sacrifice of data correctness. It’s equally important to their reputation and brand for the implemented processes to output the correct data. The handling of data retrieval within the system, outside of just the built-in data policy on data field values when customers are inputting relevant data, is even more important. The data that is stored within the system account and returned to the customer must be valid, secure, and consistent.

When determining correctness, we don’t want to necessarily focus on the input but the output. The customer, with guidance from a built-in policy, is responsible for the input, so the team wants to validate whether the output, which is data written to the cache and then updated to the account database, is correct as well. In this instance, we will use the cache hit ratio since data is validated upon being entered and written to the cache.

![Figure 10.13 – Cache hit ratio equation](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_13.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.13 – Cache hit ratio equation**

The cache hit ratio measures the effectiveness of being able to fulfill the user data request without passing the request to the origin server (Cloudflare, 2023). *Figure 10.12*, displayed earlier in this section, describes a cache hit. A cache miss is depicted in *Figure 10.14*.

![Figure 10.14 – Cache misses sending the request to the origin server](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_14.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.14 – Cache misses sending the request to the origin server**

For static content, cache effectiveness is on average between 85% and 89%, while dynamic content will have a lower average. To start, the team agreed to aim for 85% and gauge the metric as it relates to developing a normal consistency. However, since this is a critical piece within the workflow, it’s important for the SLO to aim for a higher number of nines, of which is achievable.

## Data cache error rate

As another mechanism to aid in effectively measuring data performance, the team also wants to implement SLIs and SLOs surrounding error rates, to validate whether cache data is still valid. If a user sends a request to the application and thus the backend data source, the browser will validate whether there is a valid copy before sending a response back to the requestor. If the data is not valid, the browser will send a request to the original server, which is considered a cache miss, and shift through a flow to update the cache after the request to the origin server.

The prior SLI focuses on improving the cache hit ratio; therefore, we want to capture the errors thrown to better gauge when failures occur, how frequently, and where. The cache system consists of **Entity Tags** (**ETs**), which serve as unique identifiers for specific resources by the respective server. We know we can use the headers to compare the tags of the current version of a resource with the cache version of a resource. In the event that the two match, the server will respond with a `304 Not Modified` status, where the data can still be used.

In this instance, the SLI should measure the cache freshness by tracking the percentage of cache reads that return stale data. Additionally, an error rate SLI should be defined as the percentage of requests that failed due to stale or invalid cache responses over a rolling 28-day period.

# Prioritizing SLIs by business impact

The final stage of our process is prioritization. This helps the team gauge how to implement the build process for the respective SLIs and SLOs. We won’t go into as many details as we have done in previous chapters. At a high level, the prioritization process helps us to capture the business impact of an SLI against feasibility. *Figure 10.10* provides a representation of our SLIs as they relate to team and broader business unit prioritization.

![Figure 10.15 – New feature SLI prioritization based on business impact and feasibility](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_10_15.jpg)<br>
**Figure 10.15 – New feature SLI prioritization based on business impact and feasibility**

As it relates to prioritization, each component being measured is part of a single workflow or feature implemented within the system. The team agrees that each SLO is feasible to implement based on the SLIs, and prioritization should be driven by business impact. For the purposes of the text and flow of the workshop chapters, determining what to implement based on business impact versus feasibility does not require as much work as in previous chapters. However, it’s imperative to remember that the prioritization process should consist of a ranking system identified by the team running the workshop and signed off by the team doing the work. This ensures that the system is unbiased and helps provide organization regarding the order in which items are implemented.

In addition, some teams will have internal processes that are currently used to manage existing backlogs and items in progress to report up the management pipeline. It is helpful, especially in a virtual environment, if the team utilizes as many practices as possible that resonate with the team’s working style.

# Summary

In this chapter, we have focused on building SLIs and SLOs for new features. This includes new features identified by the customer base, internal backlogs, or iterating through items identified ad hoc during a workshop. In addition, we’ve also reiterated the importance of using visual aids such as sequence diagrams and internal architecture diagrams to help understand your system boundaries. It’s important that your team establishes various ways to work through the process in a collaborative environment.

This chapter concludes the workshop portion of this book. The goal of the workshop is to help teams, business groups or units, and organizations structure conversations with the right stakeholders, ensuring that the right SLIs are measured and corresponding SLOs are defined to improve service reliability and meet customer expectations.

In the next section of the book, you can expect to shift the conversation toward daily operations and additional topics that will help you to maintain SLOs. You can also expect to cover topics that will help you to decide how to package much of it as a solution, whether that is internal or external to your organization.
