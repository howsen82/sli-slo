# Establishing an SLI and SLO Team

In the previous chapter, we highlighted the hierarchy of pillars that make up what we know as the practice of reliability engineering. In addition, we were able to center the foundational principles around **Service Level Indicators** (**SLIs**), what they are, why we need them, and what they mean to reliability engineering. In this chapter, you can expect to explore many of the critical aspects of implementing SLIs and **Service Level Objectives** (**SLOs**) using a dedicated team. Your SLIs and SLOs play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, availability, and performance of your systems and services. It is equally important to have the right mix of team members to bring your indicators to fruition.

We will first examine the significance of having a dedicated team for creating and managing your SLIs and SLOs, provide guidelines for assembling and tailoring the team, and discuss strategies for adapting the structure to organizational dynamics.

While this chapter of the book may seem straightforward, it is crucial to structure the right team members for the right tasks, just as it is to identify the correct metrics for the appropriate system components. In addition, increased organization and unification of a team can help to improve organizational buy-in and increase adoption rates and the ability to embed within the overall culture through more streamlined processes.

In this chapter, we’ll cover the following main topics:

* The significance of a dedicated team
* Guidelines for team assembly
* Tailoring to team and organizational needs
* Adapting the structure to organizational dynamics

Let’s get started!

# The significance of a dedicated team

In the pursuit of system reliability and increased performance, having a dedicated team that is focused on managing SLIs and SLOs continuously proves to remain a priority. This section elaborates on the significance of such a team, highlighting its importance, and delineating the roles and responsibilities of team members. We will also discuss the benefits of centralizing SLI and SLO management through additional case studies and examples that showcase the impact of a dedicated team on reliability and performance improvement.

If SLIs are to be implemented within a business domain, group, or organization, it’s essential to involve a mix of internal roles involved in the conversation. When initially discussing reliability engineering, we immediately shift to concepts such as availability, software, and systems engineers or developers. We need to shift this perspective toward including our program, product, and project managers, which are tied closely to the product as it relates to the customer experience and user requirements. It’s not only important to create and implement objectives but also important that we think of the ongoing maintenance, reducing scope creep, and ensuring healthy channels are maintained between the technical team, the work being done, and the stakeholders invested in the initiative.

## The importance of leveraging a dedicated team for SLI and SLO management

The importance of having a dedicated team for managing SLIs and SLOs cannot be overstated. Such a team is essential for ensuring that reliability goals are clearly defined, monitored, and maintained over time. By centralizing responsibility within a dedicated team for leading their SLI and SLO initiatives, organizations can ensure accountability, consistency, and alignment with business objectives.

If we take the approach of comparing it to a piece of internal infrastructure, think of the kernel in a Linux operating system, the control plane in a Kubernetes cluster, or the main branch in your production repository. There needs to be a single source of truth, and this source of truth needs to be managed in a way that is easily consumable by external customers, in some cases, and the broader organization.

## Roles and responsibilities of team members, including SLI owners and stakeholders

Within a dedicated team for SLIs and SLOs, various roles and responsibilities are assigned to ensure effective management and oversight. This oversight alleviates many knowledge gaps and ensures an all-hands-on-deck approach from various perspectives within an organization. For the most part, when the need arises for SLIs, we want to ensure they are created in a way that enables the team to tie the data to internal metrics that are important to upper management. This can include metrics that contribute to internally holding technical teams accountable or support decision-making related to external commitments such as product **Service Level Agreements** (**SLAs**). In some instances, management may simply want quantifiable metrics in place to ensure nothing goes awry.

It can even consist of a team of individuals who simply want to implement these measurements to improve the work that they are completing, reduce technical toil and debt, or ensure they can report back to internal leaders regarding how their service is performing. Either way, none of the reasons are incorrect. We want to put our best foot forward to ensure that we can do these things in the most efficient way possible. Success greatly depends on the team composition, and ensuring that everyone contributes, owns, and develops the process to help capture the necessary voices and perspectives.

The following are roles that were central and key to the implementation of SLIs and SLOs within my team’s organization:

* **SRE**: The group of SREs that are going to own the **end-to-end (E2E)** SRE process. This group is responsible for driving the definition, monitoring, and optimization practices for SLIs and SLOs to accurately measure system performance.
* **SLI owners**: They are also tasked with setting, monitoring, and ensuring that SLO targets are met. This group will include the SREs or other software developers who are familiar with the product or service being measured and will own the SLIs once they are handed off, if not maintained by the initial SRE team.
* **Program managers** (**PMs**): PMs are tasked with the overarching responsibility of ensuring that the work that is being done can be tied back into the strategic goals of the broader organization. This reverts to the mention of scope creep within a program or project. This is something that is often downplayed but alleviates the responsibility of documentation and organization alignment from engineers who will need to focus mainly on the technical aspects of the initiatives.
* **Stakeholders**: This can include external customers, engineers, executives, or anyone else investing in or sponsoring the SLI and SLO initiatives. They will play a crucial role in providing input, feedback, and support to the team, ensuring that reliability goals are aligned with broader organizational objectives and consumer requirements.
* **Product engineers**: The engineers that are responsible for the design, development, and maintenance of the product and services requiring SLIs and SLOs. It’s important to schedule your workshops surrounding this audience as they will have the most insights into the current state of the system and system boundaries.

Roles and responsibilities are mentioned to provide insight. This does not mean that you will have one from each category, or that you need to include all of them. It is to raise awareness of specific roles to internally identify, if required. Assigning the responsibilities of SLI and SLO management to a dedicated team offers numerous benefits for an organization. By consolidating responsibility within a single team, organizations can do the following:

* Streamline communication, coordination, and decision-making processes to improve communication throughout the SLO management journey.
* Facilitate a more cohesive and effective approach to reliability management improving internal buy-in and adoption rates.
* Leverage collective expertise, best practices, and lessons learned to drive continuous improvement and innovation in reliability engineering practices.

If your organization plans to package and sell reliability as a service, then it is even more important that the various roles work together to ensure customer success through individuals who own the external communication pipeline. Different experiences lead to different perspectives and voices contributing to innovation.

The goal of this book is not to reinvent the wheel but rather to guide you through solutions to challenges experienced throughout the SLO design, implementation, and management journey. Therefore, if you are interested in learning more regarding the various structures of SRE teams, then I suggest you review the blog text, *How SRE teams are organized, and how to get started* (details can be found in the *Further reading* section) by former Google SREs as a starting point. In a nutshell, you will learn how SRE teams have been structured within different organizations:

* **Kitchen sink SRE teams**: A single SRE team doing everything within a smaller scope, seen primarily in organizations where SRE is starting.
* **Infrastructure-based SRE teams**: Teams that are focused primarily on infrastructure-related tasks, typically clusters and CI/CD operations.
* **Tooling-focused SRE teams**: SRE teams that focus primarily on improving the developer experience through various types of tooling.
* **Product/application-specific SRE teams**: SRE teams that focus on business-critical or targeted applications and services.
* **Embedded SRE teams**: SRE teams that are placed within other development teams to ensure SRE alignment. This can be aligned with a product, service, or application team.
* **Consulting SRE teams**: Like embedded SRE teams, except consultants are not going to write or manage customers’ application code and configurations.

So far, we understand the importance of having a dedicated team and what role each team member and stakeholder plays. Let’s solidify this learning with the help of an example case study.

## A case study to illustrate the impact of a dedicated team

There are several case studies and examples that highlight the tangible impact of a dedicated team on service reliability and performance improvement. We can also conclude that the main contributor to the success of your SRE organization is understanding the type of SRE team required and then staffing it with the right mix of individuals and skill sets to see the process through.

For instance, a leading bank, Standard Chartered Bank, embarked on its SRE journey, which included first creating a dedicated team. Let’s take a look at this case study, which can also be viewed via the DevOps Institute as *From Pilot to Scale, The Successful SRE Journey at a Large Financial Institution*. To build their team, the bank took the following actions:

* Initiated an approved pilot within their organization by forming a team of five individual SRE “evangelists” that they felt would benefit from the model.
* Enabled/allowed the SREs to maintain continuous and iterative conversations with key stakeholders and individuals key to the practice of SRE.
* Trained everyone on the core and foundational principles of SRE.
* Assigned each SRE a single application that they were responsible for building the SRE journey for.

Richard Hall, the organization’s Global Head of Transformation, Resilience, and Architecture for Functions T&I, coined it in *From Pilot* *to Scale*:

“Continuous learning was a major factor in successfully changing the mindset within our team. We put education at the heart of our program, and we have gone from ‘What is SRE?’, to now being asked, when SRE can be deployed on their applications.”

This statement is crucial for two reasons:

* It validates the importance of investing time upfront in your employees and understanding the need to allocate time for learning and communication during the process.
* The former validates these findings because they opted to hire individuals they felt would benefit from the model, not due to them already having had experience with a specific model.

This case highlights the importance of diverse perspectives and roles in guiding the SRE journey. It is also necessary to state that this team started with five SREs and can also be described as a research and innovation team. This means that your organization may initially start with a team of just five SRE engineers. And that, too, is okay.

A dedicated team for managing SLIs and SLOs plays a crucial role in ensuring improved system performance and availability. By delegating responsibility to a central team, defining clear roles and responsibilities, and leveraging collective expertise, organizations can drive improvements in reliability with improved efficiency in less time, enhance customer satisfaction, and, ultimately, achieve greater success in today’s increasingly distributed environments.

# Guidelines for team assembly

Assembling a dedicated SLI and SLO management team requires careful consideration of various factors. Organizations must assess the scope and complexity of their reliability objectives, as well as the resources available for team assembly. As previously mentioned, in some organizations, this task might begin as a single-member team. Additionally, factors such as organizational structure, culture, and existing processes need to be considered to ensure internal alignment with other teams and request support for the dedicated team.

With many organizations in the current workforce trying to increase the efficiency of remote and hybrid work styles, it is important to understand that when structuring your team, it is a must that you take inventory of the current culture and hierarchy of your organization to ensure the accuracy of identified candidates. This includes whether you are required to hire external SREs to join your organization. Having worked on globally distributed teams within the last year of writing this text, my team took the liberty of assessing management styles in remote environments. Some questions that you may want to ask before building your SRE team are as follows:

* **Does our organization have internal** **SRE engineers?**

  If the answer to this question is yes, then you will need to take inventory of whether it is a single team or many teams within an organization. If there are many teams, are there SRE teams that can invest in the process by allocating a few engineers to the initiative? If it’s a single team, then are you able to reprioritize the work you do in a way that makes room to build out a more structured SRE team?

  If your organization does not have an SRE team, then it’s important to understand why you want to adopt SRE to help identify the type of SRE team you want to build. That is not to say the trajectory will remain the same but as a friend once said, “*If you don’t know where you are going, then any road is likely to get you there. Just start.*” It will prove helpful if you can assess the current workload and processes to guide your SRE process in a direction that supports the organization and the current work being done.

* **What type of SRE team do we assume** **we want?**

  If your organization is new to SRE, this question may not be immediately clear. Something like the previously mentioned Google blog regarding the types of SRE teams that exist can help you determine the answer to this question based on your current state.

Another audit those invested can take is assessing the type of tooling, platforms, or applications that are currently used to support service management. This should help guide you in the right direction. Often, speaking to or surveying internal development and product teams’ pain points can act as another avenue of assessment.

Internal colleagues are going to want to invest in anything that solves a problem and improves workflow efficiency. If it results in economic or monetary gains while eliminating or reducing complex problems within the customer experience, then you’re speaking the stakeholder’s language. Improving the latter also reduces the workloads and requests submitted to internal support and customer success teams.

## Identifying key stakeholders and subject matter experts within the organization

Identifying key stakeholders and subject matter experts within the organization is essential for ensuring the success of the dedicated team. These individuals bring valuable insights, domain knowledge, and organizational context to the conversation. They will also help the team to navigate facilitation and collaboration while ensuring alignment with broader business objectives is maintained. Key stakeholders may include internal engineers, external customers, operations personnel, and executives, among many others.

In the event your organization is newly adopting SRE, the task at hand may also include marketing or selling the idea of SRE to internal stakeholders. This relates to the earlier task of identifying internal pain points that SREs can solve and mapping monetary gains and losses. Does your organization have external SLAs that do not include internal mechanisms to ensure they are met? Marketing the idea of utilizing SLOs to the value of dollars lost if/when an SLA is breached will help drive the selling point.

My previous experience also includes working in development and technical support teams. An insight that I have developed is that there are customers who hold an organization to the SLA commitments that they make down to the dollar. What this means is that if a customer signs a contract with an expected SLA and continuously finds themselves submitting issues to the support team regarding downtime and outages, a good percentage of customers invest the time to do the calculations to request monetary reimbursement. This is also not limited to contracts and includes externally available SLA guidelines, too.

You can then market this to your organization as an opportunity to operate more efficiently in a way that notifies us before we breach, as well as enables the organization to forecast and make technical decisions before disrupting the customer’s experience with our platform, products, and services.

## Skills and expertise required for effective SLI and SLO management

Effective SLI and SLO management requires a diverse set of skills and expertise. It is not a requirement but can lighten the load on the team if team members possess skills such as technical proficiency in areas such as data analysis, monitoring tools, and system architecture, as well as strong communication and collaboration skills. It is commonly observed that some of the most technically skilled individuals may not excel in communication and collaboration. Even if they are the best, sometimes the focus needs to shift to the technical work required and utilize a program or project manager to handle much of the communication and collaboration external to the team, if needed. This also passively helps the team to maintain better control of documenting processes and implementation workflows. The same way we refer to engineer burnout in incident management is the same consideration we should have throughout the SLO journey.

Additionally, domain-specific knowledge related to the organization’s products, services, and customer needs is crucial for defining meaningful SLIs and SLOs that align with business objectives. If your current SREs lack this knowledge, then collaborating among product staff can help fill in the necessary gaps.

# Tailoring to team and organizational needs

While identifying individuals to create and structure your team or once you have created your team, it is going to be crucial to customize the SLI and SLO management practices to suit the unique requirements of both the team and organization to achieve success in reliability engineering. This section emphasizes the importance of tailoring SLIs and SLOs to align with specific organizational needs and objectives, reducing the occurrence of adding or increasing silos through consistent communication processes and feedback loops.

Incorporating feedback-friendly processes in this section is highlighted as a crucial aspect of effective SLI and SLO management if you want to increase proactive response. By taking a more structured approach to soliciting and analyzing feedback from stakeholders, product-centered engineers, and other required individuals, organizations can gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of their SLIs and SLOs and identify areas for improvement. This iterative process enables organizations to continuously refine and optimize their reliability practices to better meet the shifting needs of their users and stakeholders.

Ensuring alignment with organizational objectives and priorities is essential for maximizing the impact of SLI and SLO management efforts. When we align SLIs and SLOs with broader organizational goals, teams can ensure that their reliability initiatives contribute directly to the success of the business. This alignment fosters a cohesive approach to reliability engineering, where every effort is directed toward achieving strategic objectives and driving business value.

Tailoring SLI and SLO management practices to the specific needs of the team and organization is a foundational aspect of effective reliability engineering and will increase the acceptance of the shift in a new direction. This is also an important task when considering managing change. By creating SLIs and SLOs, incorporating feedback mechanisms, and aligning with organizational objectives, your team will optimize their reliability practices and achieve greater success in meeting the needs of their users and stakeholders at a much more rapid pace.

## Incorporating feedback mechanisms

Incorporating feedback mechanisms is essential for continuously refining and improving SLI and SLO definitions. This may include soliciting input from stakeholders, gathering insights from monitoring data, and conducting regular reviews and retrospectives to assess the effectiveness of existing metrics and objectives. By embracing a culture of continuous improvement, organizations can adapt their SLIs and SLOs to evolving business needs and technological landscapes. To get your team started on the right track, you can consider and incorporate the following guidelines to start building out your process, as depicted in *Figure 2.1*.

![Figure 2.1 – Incorporating feedback into SLO feedback loops](https://static.packt-cdn.com/products/9781835889381/graphics/image/B22155_02_1.jpg)<br>
**Figure 2.1 – Incorporating feedback into SLO feedback loops**

*Figure 2.1* shows the workflow for incorporating feedback mechanisms as a solution to meet the needs of your team and broader organization:

1. **Define feedback channels**: Establish clear channels for collecting feedback from various stakeholders, including users, customers, internal teams, and management. Typical methods include surveys, user interviews, support tickets, feedback forms, user forums, and social media platforms. Lean more toward channels that are accessible and convenient for your target audience during the beginning stages to ease the data collection process during the infant stages.

   The team can set aside time to solicit different internal channels that may already be in place internally and merely adopt the process that stakeholders and others are accustomed to, to decrease the amount of time required to ramp up on a new process.

2. **Regularly gather feedback**: Implement processes that support a healthy cadence for regularly gathering feedback at key touchpoints throughout the user journey. Establishing the right cadence for collecting feedback is just as important as selecting the appropriate method. It ensures that data is gathered at the most relevant points in the user journey. Too much or too little feedback can have a negative or positive impact on stakeholders and any other individuals you are attempting to win over during this process. Soliciting feedback from stakeholders, users, and customers after key interactions is important throughout the entire process to confirm that the team is on the right track. Feedback is not only necessary for stages such as product launches, feature releases, service outages, or support interactions but is imperative during the beginning stages to ensure that “what” is being measured and “how” it is being measured remain in alignment with the overall goal. Ensure that feedback collection is ongoing and systematic to capture insights in real time.

3. **Analyze and synthesize feedback**: Once feedback has been collected, analyze and synthesize the data to identify common themes, trends, and patterns. During the initial stages, qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques can provide valuable insights into user preferences, though they may not be essential early on. During later stages when personas have been developed, user journeys outlined and defined, and SLIs and SLOs created, we may want to consider this a bit more. Moreover, take inventory of pain points and areas for improvement communicated by those you are interacting with or interviewing. Prioritize feedback based on its impact on SLIs, the SLO process, as well as organizational objectives.

4. **Integrate feedback into SLIs and SLOs**: During the later stages of SLI and SLO development, the team must understand how to use feedback insights to inform the definition and refinement of SLIs and SLOs. If we take inventory of requirements during the infant stages, we can and will create processes that do not require as much refinement later in the process. The team should proactively identify opportunities to adjust SLIs and SLOs based on user feedback to better align with user expectations and priorities. Ensure that SLIs and SLOs are aligned with user needs and contribute to improved reliability, performance, and user satisfaction.

5. **Communicate findings and actions**: Communicate feedback findings and actions taken to address feedback to relevant stakeholders across the organization. Share insights from feedback analysis, as well as any changes or improvements made to SLIs and SLOs because of feedback. Transparency and communication are essential for building trust and engagement with stakeholders. The sentiment here is like developing a healthy cadence; the method of communication used to communicate findings and actions is correlated to the customer experience for internal stakeholders and engineering teams, as well as externally facing customers if your service level journey includes them.

6. **Iterate and improve**: Use feedback as a catalyst for continuous improvement in SLI and SLO management processes. Iterate on SLIs and SLOs based on ongoing feedback and data-driven insights. Regularly review and update SLIs and SLOs to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in supporting organizational goals and meeting user expectations. We will dive more into this in the third part of this book, which will include practices for doing so.

7. **Close the feedback loop**: Close the feedback loop by following up with users and stakeholders to communicate how their feedback has been addressed and implemented. Acknowledge and thank users for their input and demonstrate how their feedback has influenced decision-making and improvements. Closing the feedback loop fosters trust and accountability with stakeholders and encourages ongoing engagement in the feedback process. It also showcases to other internal teams the impact of doing so. In some instances, it may require you to further engage with the team and continue through the cycle, shifting back toward regularly gathering feedback.

Much of software and technology development and maintenance is done through iterative approaches. The same philosophy is utilized for the SLO design, implementation, and management processes. As with most iterative approaches, success is achieved more efficiently when collaboration and alignment between different functions occurs.

## Ensuring alignment with organizational objectives

Ensuring alignment between quantified performance and organizational objectives through service level measurements is critical for driving success in reliability engineering. SLIs and SLOs should be directly tied to business outcomes and priorities, such as customer satisfaction, revenue generation, and operational efficiency. By establishing clear alignment between technical metrics and organizational goals, teams can demonstrate the value of reliability engineering and garner support from key stakeholders, while providing internal accountability for meeting SLAs with external customers.

Tailoring SLI and SLO management practices to meet the specific needs of the team and organization is essential for achieving success in reliability engineering. By customizing SLIs and SLOs, incorporating feedback mechanisms, and ensuring alignment with organizational objectives, organizations can drive continuous improvement and deliver reliable and resilient systems and services that meet the needs of customers and stakeholders.

# Adapting the structure to organizational dynamics

Adapting the structure of the SLI and SLO management team to organizational dynamics is essential for success in reliability engineering. This summary encapsulates key insights from the chapter, including strategies for adaptation, addressing challenges, implementing agile approaches, and building resilience into the management framework. Once your team is identified, establish clear guiding principles to maintain alignment with objectives and stay on course.

## Strategies for adapting the structure

Organizational dynamics vary widely across different companies and industries. Therefore, it’s crucial to adapt the structure of the SLI and SLO management team to fit the specific needs and dynamics of the organization. This may involve restructuring teams, reallocating resources, and adjusting processes to ensure alignment with broader organizational goals and objectives. To ensure internal alignment between your organization’s indicators and objectives, your team will need to do the following:

* **Understand organizational goals**: Before beginning your service-level journey, you’ll want to start by ensuring that you understand your organization’s overarching goals and objectives. Ask yourself and your team, “*What are the key priorities for your organization?*” and “*How does your organization define success?*”. These are questions that can be asked of the stakeholders involved with your SLO initiative and of any other teams or lines of management that you are required to interface with regarding the service or process you are to measure. Understanding these goals will help you tailor your SLIs and SLOs to directly support these objectives.

  The way we adapt the implementation to fit the organizational culture and dynamics plays a crucial role in the success of adoption. It is imperative to understand what the broader organization or business groups are utilizing internally to better find alignment in the team that you are building and the SLIs and objectives your team will choose to measure.
* **Identify key performance metrics**: Upon understanding the overarching organizational goals, you’ll want to then identify the critical performance metrics that directly impact your organization’s success. These could include metrics related to system reliability, availability, performance, and user experience. Consult with stakeholders from various departments to ensure that you capture a comprehensive view of performance requirements. This step is crucial to gain visibility into what the organization is currently measuring and how each metric is being measured.

  The typical organization will likely maintain performance metrics surrounding operational, financial, and many other areas. The goal here is to understand what success looks like for your organization and possibly capture whether these metrics relate to or tie back to the customer experience, and how. We can think of this as an exploratory step that can act as an additional avenue to identify customer personas and customer sentiment and find alignment between organizational KPIs and future SLIs and SLOs.

You may also want to collaborate with customer-facing teams to help identify internal SLAs that can act as a starting point. It is also possible for an organization to have external commitments without developing the internal and necessary processes for technical accountability.

## Addressing challenges

Organizational silos, conflicting priorities, and communication barriers are common challenges that can impede the effectiveness of SLI and SLO management efforts. To address these challenges, organizations must foster collaboration, break down silos, and establish clear lines of communication between teams and stakeholders. Additionally, creating a shared understanding of priorities and goals can help mitigate conflicts and ensure alignment across the organization. The previously mentioned challenges are difficult to resolve outside of SLI and SLO management.

To better support the process, let’s outline ways to address and potentially resolve each respective challenge:

* **Foster collaboration**: Encourage collaboration across different teams and departments involved in SLI and SLO management. This is a must as the SRE teams managing the process will need to communicate with stakeholders and engineers who maintain the subject matter expertise necessary for the platform, application, or service they are measuring. Foster a culture of openness, trust, and knowledge-sharing to break down silos and promote teamwork. Silos are one of the top reasons for communication breakdowns within an organization. This issue often goes unnoticed until it becomes a significant challenge. We will discuss more of this in a later section when agile methodologies and processes are mentioned.

* **Break down silos**: Identify and address organizational silos that may hinder collaboration and communication. Encourage transparency and information-sharing between teams by promoting cross-departmental visibility and cooperation. Establish channels for sharing insights, best practices, and lessons learned across the organization to facilitate a more integrated approach to SLI and SLO management.

  Silos tend to arise because of how we manage communication frequency and methods when compared to the overall need of specific teams or business groups within an organization. Silos tend to be caused by three main reasons:

  + Emphasis placed on domain expertise versus general and cross-functional knowledge
  + Processes are divided among multiple owners
  + Geographic dispersion

  In addition, silos can occur without realizing they are occurring. In the **Price Waterhouse Cooper** (**PwC**) text, *Dealing with Market Disruption: 7 Strategies for Breaking Down Silos*, a few strategies to avoid the shift toward silos or to break down existing silos are mentioned. Highlighted in the following list are actions/tasks to keep top of mind to reduce the chances of occurring or reoccurring silos:

  + Align leaders and build governance
  + Create cross-functional teams
  + Create clear roles and responsibilities
  + Create join incentives
  + Co-locate teams during the transformation period
  + Create a “two in a box” structure
  + Clarify decision rights

* **Establish clear communication channels**: Improve communication channels and processes to ensure that information flows smoothly between teams and stakeholders. Use a combination of communication tools such as email, chat platforms, and project management software to facilitate communication and collaboration. Establish clear roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths to streamline communication and decision-making processes.

* **Create a shared understanding of priorities**: Align teams and stakeholders around common priorities and goals related to SLI and SLO management. Communicate the importance of reliability, performance, and user satisfaction as organizational priorities. Facilitate discussions and workshops to create a shared understanding of the significance of SLIs and SLOs in achieving these priorities and goals.

* **Mitigate conflicting priorities**: Address conflicting priorities by facilitating open dialogue and negotiation between stakeholders. Encourage teams to identify areas of overlap and potential conflicts early on and work together to find mutually beneficial solutions. Prioritize initiatives and projects based on their alignment with organizational goals and the potential impact on SLIs and SLOs.

* **Provide training and education**: Invest in training and education programs to enhance the skills and knowledge of teams involved in SLI and SLO management. Offer workshops, seminars, and online courses to help teams develop a deeper understanding of SLI and SLO concepts, best practices, and tools. Empower teams to take ownership of SLI and SLO management by providing them with the necessary resources and support. This can also be the output of the process developed by the initial SRE team, which is true for many organizations with reliability engineering organizations.

By implementing these strategies, organizations can overcome the challenges of organizational silos, conflicting priorities, and communication barriers in SLI and SLO management efforts. By fostering collaboration, breaking down silos, establishing clear communication channels, creating a shared understanding of priorities, and mitigating conflicting priorities, organizations can enhance the effectiveness and impact of their SLI and SLO management practices.

## Implementing the best approach for your team

Agile and iterative approaches to SLI and SLO management enable organizations to adapt quickly to changing requirements and conditions. Embracing agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban will help teams prioritize tasks, respond to feedback, and deliver value incrementally. This iterative approach allows organizations to continuously refine and improve their SLIs and SLOs based on real-world data and feedback. It also improves the implementation process for the SRE team and other staff.

Many organizations tend to utilize an agile methodology or certain capabilities of the agile methodology to build software, processes, and run teams. Agile methodologies and their alternatives are utilized for the ability to iterate and work in short sprints at a faster cadence. It does not necessarily mean it is always the right approach but is utilized when development or an initiative requires a framework that enables them to respond quickly to change and release changes in an incremental manner.

### Alternatives to agile approaches

As previously mentioned, the goal of this section is not to persuade you to adopt a specific methodology or to even advocate for or against one. It is to raise awareness of the things that, if considered during the beginning stages for your team and use case, will only simplify things in the long term. There are many alternatives available to utilize. Some teams may even find it best to simply isolate specific workflows from a methodology to use within the team. Let’s have a look at other alternatives that our SRE or implementation team can benefit from:

* **Waterfall**: In contrast to agile’s iterative approach, the waterfall methodology follows a sequential process where each phase of development is completed before moving on to the next. There is usually some dependency required before beginning the next phase. While less flexible than agile, waterfall may be suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and stable environments, and not ideal for SLO management.
* **Lean**: Lean methodology focuses on minimizing waste and maximizing value delivery. It emphasizes continuous improvement and customer-centricity, like agile. Lean principles can complement Agile practices and help streamline SLI and SLO management processes.
* **DevOps**: DevOps promotes collaboration and integration between development and operations teams to improve software delivery and reliability. While not a project management methodology like Agile, DevOps principles can influence how SLIs and SLOs are managed and monitored throughout the software development life cycle. Much of the later chapters will align with the DevOps focus.
* **Six Sigma**: Six Sigma is a data-driven approach to process improvement that aims to reduce defects and variability in business processes. While primarily used in manufacturing and quality management, Six Sigma principles can be applied to SLI and SLO management to identify and address performance issues systematically.

The methodologies and practices your team utilizes to implement SLIs and SLOs will play a pivotal role in the success of your SLO initiative. When considering structuring a team for SLI and SLO management, understanding the various processes and frameworks available will help you identify individuals with various skill sets in the early stages. Although it is not a requirement early on, it will only reduce later complications. In the event you are considering a small or single-person team, hopefully, this provides you with information that helps to improve the beginning stages of your journey.

# Summary

Building resilience and flexibility into the SLI and SLO management framework is essential for accommodating change and uncertainty. This task is only achieved through investing in individuals and the processes they use to implement and manage the SLI and SLO processes. This helps to achieve the goal of designing processes and systems that can adapt to evolving business needs, technological advancements, and market dynamics. Building resiliency into the management framework will enhance sustainability for an organization and safeguard the longevity of reliability engineering efforts.

Adapting the structure of the SLI and SLO management team to organizational dynamics is crucial for achieving success in reliability engineering.
